They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
She okay?
Let's go.
Wow
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
No
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"The ""real you""."
What good stuff?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
"Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself."
What crap?
do you listen to this crap?
No...
You always been this selfish?
But
Then that's all you had to say.
"Well, no..."
"You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?"
I was?
Tons
Have fun tonight?
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity?
"Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?"
Hi.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
She's not a...
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Sure have.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You're sweet.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
You got something on your mind?
Where?
There.
"Well, there's someone I think might be --"
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
"Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend..."
That's a shame.
Why?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Cameron.
"No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---"
Forget it.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
"Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you."
I did.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Is he oily or dry?
"Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?"
Great
Joey.
Who?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
No.
Did you change your hair?
"Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom."
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
"Hi, Joey."
"Hey, sweet cheeks."
Neat...
Queen Harry?
Hopefully.
"Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?"
Expensive?
It's more
Perm?
Patrick -- is that- a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted --
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
"You looked beautiful last night, you know."
"I guess I'll never know, will I?"
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
But
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
As in...
"Now I do.  Back then, was a different story."
But you hate Joey
"He was, like, a total babe"
Why?
In 9th.  For a month
What?
"Joey never told you we went out, did he?"
Like you care.
You're welcome.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
What's normal?
"You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal."
What do you think?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
"Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?"
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
"Nowhere... Hi, Daddy."
Where've you been?
I'm missing something.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
"No, but"
The prom?  Kat has a date?
"Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --"
Because she'll scare them away.
Why?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Just for a minute
"Daddy, no!"
Wear the belly before you go.
It's just a party. Daddy.
"Oh, God.  It's starting."
"If Kat's not going, you're not going."
"Daddy, people expect me to be there!"
Otherwise known as an orgy?
And where're you going?
"Daddy, I --"
Exactly my point
But she doesn't want to date.
"But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!"
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
What if she never starts dating?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Just sent 'em through.
"Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?"
Never
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
"Always a pleasure, Brucie."
"Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile."
"No, I ' m not."
"Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress."
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
You told me that part already.
It's her favorite band.
Assail your ears for one night.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
He's pretty!
Dead at forty-one.
Her favorite uncle
It's a lung cancer issue
Number one.  She hates smokers
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Will Bogey get bent?
"In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out."
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
You got him involved?
I thought you hated those people.
That's what I just said
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
He seems like he thrives on danger
What makes you think he'll do it?
You wanna go out with him?
What about him?
"The mewling, rampalian wretch herself."
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
"Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew."
"You could consecrate with her, my friend."
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You know French?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Why not?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Who is she?
"You burn, you pine, you perish?"
That girl -- I --
That I'm used to.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
How many people go here?
Get out!
Thirty-two.
How many people were in your old school?
"Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though."
I was kidding. People actually live there?
"North, actually.  How'd you   ?"
So -- which Dakota you from?
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So they tell me...
You the new guy?
You get the girl.
What's the worst?
Where?
She kissed me.
You makin' any headway?
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
What'd you do to her?
"Then, go get her"
Sure
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
"She's partial to Joey, not me"
What 're you talking about?
It's off. The whole thing.
"Cameron, I'm a little busy"
"Don't make me do it, man"
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What've you got for me?
Yeah -- we'll see.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
And why would I do that?
Leave my sister alone.
Your sister here?
Away.
Where ya goin?
Not at all
Hey -- do you mind?
They're running the rest of me next month.
"The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?"
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
"I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --"
Get her to act like a human
Do what?
How'd you do it?
A deal's a deal.
It's about time.
"Forget her sister, then."
Forget it.
A hundred bucks a date.
What?
I just upped my price
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I'm on it
"When I shell out fifty, I expect results."
"Fifty, and you've got your man."
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
"Fine, thirty."
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
How much?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
"You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors."
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
"Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it."
"Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her."
"Two legs, nice rack..."
What do you think?
Yeah
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You and Verona?
"Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*"
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
We're not.
We don't chat.
Nope - just came by to chat
Are you lost?
Hey.
"Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations."
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Who?
Have you seen him?
"Oh, good.  Something new and different for us."
"Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway"
"Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates ."
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I didn't have a choice.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
No fear.
You think this'll work?
Does it matter?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
That's never been proven
William didn't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
An attempted slit.
What's this?
Just a little.
"Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die."
Block E?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Who's that?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
"Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?"
Because I like to torture you.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
"Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her."
Is that right?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I didn't care about the money.
It wasn't like that.
Wait I...
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That ' s completely adorable!
What?
My grandmother's .
"Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong."
Oh huh
It's just something I had.  You know
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
"Answer the question, Patrick"
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Why not?
"No, I won't go with you"
No what?
No.
You know what I mean
Is that a request or a command?
Go to the prom with me
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No one else knows
What?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
I hate peas.
Tell me something true.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Hearsay.
The duck?
Fallacy.
State trooper?
For. . . ?
You up for it?
You never disappointed me.
How?
Then you screwed up
Something like that
"So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?"
Yes
Acting the way we do.
So what's your excuse?
"Yeah, well, don't let it get out"
A soft side? Who knew?
I dazzled him with my wit
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Good call.
The Partridge Family?
Maybe.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Put your right foot there --
Try lookin' at it from this angle
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
"Look up, sunshine"
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome.
Wholesome.
Pleasant?
You 're so --
I heard there was a poetry reading.
What are you doing here?
"Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy."
BIANCA
Who?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
I'm gettin' there
"Oh, so now you think you know me?"
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Start a band?
This.
Do what?
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
Then why'd you ask?
"No, you weren't"
Maybe.
Were you in jail?
Busy
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
And I'm in control of it.
What?
Kat! Wake up!
You know what they say
I thought you were above all that
I hate him.
Dorsey.
Who?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Just let me sit down.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Like you could find one
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Why?
"Sure, I do"
You don't care if I die
I told you
Why 're you doing this?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
This is so patronizing.
"I know, just let me sleep"
"Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep"
I just need to lie down for awhile
You're not okay.
I'm fine. I'm
Okay?
"Funny, you're the only one"
"I say, do what you wanna do."
What's this?
"Why, don't you?"
You know who The Raincoats are?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
"That's what you want, isn't it?"
Excuse me?
"hey.  Great show, huh?"
"You're not a big talker, are you?"
Hi
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Are you following me?
Seven-thirty?
You -- covered in my vomit.
And why would I do that?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You hate me don't you?
I know a lot more than that
"Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?"
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
"Oh, right.  Friday."
"Pick you up Friday, then"
My mission in life.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
"Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?"
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
When I go?
No -- impressed.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Bianca did what?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Which parts?
Parts of it.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
"No, Daddy."
Funny.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Was that your sister?
So what I want doesn't matter?
"As a parent, that's my right"
Because you're making decisions for me.
Why can't we agree on this?
I thought you were punishing me.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Enough!
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You decided.
I know.
Just smack her now.
"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Tempestuous?
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
"Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again."
Yeah...
"Kat a fan, too?"
Right.
"Macbeth, right?"
Oh yeah.
You think?
Yeah.  I guess.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Hi.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
"Sweet love, renew thy force!"
You were right. She's still pissed.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I'm likin' you guys better
Yeah.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Just for now.
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"
Good enough.
What?!
We're your guys.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
What plan?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What?
Say it
See you next week!
You're completely demented.
What's to discuss?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
Touch of the flu.
With the teeth of your zipper?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
I missed you.
That ' s what I thought
Absolutely not.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Your daughters went to the prom.
What just happened?
But -- who -- what --?
"Have a great time, honey!"
Dr. Ruth?
"What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap"
"They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go."
Pirate -- no question.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
You're not helping.
Tumescent!
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Make anyone cry today?
In the microwave.
"We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near."
We should have seen land.
We'll all go crazy...
He's the devil's child...
"Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm."
"What are you listening to, chicken ass?"
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
"If they agree to follow me, yes."
"Your life, and that of others!"
"Excellency, you are right."
"I am, Your Eminence"
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
"It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez."
The Judgment is ours!
"What is it, now?  Tell me..."
I am busy inside.
Can't you stay with us a little?
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
You don't usually ask.
"Beatrix, I want to ask you something."
That's something you can't decide.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Thank God...
She said yes.
I find that hard to believe.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Are we going to argue?
I haven't given you much of a life.
I know.
I could be gone for years.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
How far from here?
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Appointment to what?
My letters of appointment.
Yes... I remember...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
May I ask by whom?
"Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken."
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
What does he say?
"I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing."
What are you listening to?
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Father...
Not bad.
"How are you feeling, Fernando?"
This time with me!
I have to explore the mainland.
"Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!"
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
All of them created by people like me.
"Roofs... towers, palaces... spires..."
What do you see?
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Call them.
All I have to do is call the guards.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
"Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal."
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
... for a commoner?
You defend yourself admirably...
"Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?"
"If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will."
Then you are too ambitious.
I'm not bargaining!
No?
No...
You never learned how to speak my language.
You did the same to your God!
"You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!"
Ask him if he will help.
He understands.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
Chief says...
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says -- he has a God.
To bring the word of God.
Why?
Thousands.
Chief says -- how many?
Chief knows.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
You come!  You speak first!
Island.  Far.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Say not here!  Cuba!
Oh?  So you are a new man?
New worlds create new people.
I knew you would.
I have to disagree.
"You'll always be older than me, Father."
I suppose we're both old men now.
Give me absolution.
I believed in you...
"You are bound by an oath, Father."
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
How long?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
What are you saying?
"I am listening, my son."
"Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned."
"In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti."
Colon!  Don't!
All of them!  Just lies!
Colon!
Damn God!
"If God intends you to go, then you will go."
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
"Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son."
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Passion is something one cannot control!
Father Marchena!
"I'll try to remember that, Marchena..."
So was Christ!
Esdras is a Jew.
"The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras..."
How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Why do you wish to sail west?
How did you manage it?
That's what it says.
God... That's in a week!
Thank you.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Do they have such thoughts?
"Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?"
"How old are you, Senor Colon?"
A woman?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
May I speak freely?
Surely you can do anything you want.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
That she was impregnable.
What did they say about Granada before today?
The ocean is uncrossable?
You will regret this.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
"You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse."
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
My horse doesn't work.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
We don't need to know.
"We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood."
"The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica."
We can't be.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
What's he doing?
Twenty eight.
What do you read?
Come over here.
And what do you think Mendez?
God be with us admiral.
"Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us..."
You're right.  Let the men decide.
You tell that to them!
"Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!"
You bloody...
"You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?"
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
The land is there.  I know it!
We're lost!
You think I don't know that?
"We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!"
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You must be mad...!
"Six days ago, yes."
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Immediately.
Where can I meet this man?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Then why?
"I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence."
"And who would you think of, for such a task?"
He must be replaced.
"Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?"
"Is this true, Brother Buyl?"
"Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!"
... Into a monk...
"Never, Your Majesty.  Although..."
"You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted."
"Yes, Your Majesty."
"Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?"
"Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!"
"I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture."
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your mother was blind?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
"Give me another one, please."
What else do you need?
"This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me."
But it's...
No.  No way.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
What's your cut?  How much?
"Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing."
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
"No, he is here.  Shit..."
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about Oleg?
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
"Oh, sure."
You bring the cigarettes?
"Yes.  Yes, come with me!"
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Here.  I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
"Daphne, I..."
I don't want to drag you down with me.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Pouring it out!
What are you doing?
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
Right.
You better get packed.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
"If I was your boyfriend, I might be."
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm sorry.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Are you alright?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I know.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
"Yes, I considered it."
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yeah.  This way.
So...the station is empty?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Somewhere else?
I can't take you to my place.
Divorced.
Are you married?
They won't until this is over.
I will if they don't send me back.
Now I become custody of police department?
"Yes, but he was a cop."
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
A cop?
"No, no, don't talk to Immigration!"
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
"If I tell you, will you arrest me?"
Go on.
"C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?"
"I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything."
"Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference."
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
"It was my decision, not his."
Oh.
But Chief?  Over this??
End my career?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - mind if I take her?
No!  Nothing happened.
"A shower!?  Did you take one, too?"
I let her take a shower.
"What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'"
"Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?"
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
"Who do you think, Chief?!"
Who did cause and origin?
Yeah.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
"You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does."
"What was that, Korfin?"
"Yeah, right."
"I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers."
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.  I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Stay with her.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Yeah.
Only one guys checked in?
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Any I.D.?
Takin' a bath.
Where is she?
A timer.
What's he looking for?
You ready?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
When?
I'm gonna propose.
"It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid."
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Vodka tonic.
"Coffee for me, I gotta slow down."
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Describe him.
"Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too."
What are you saying?
"Boy, she's so popular all the sudden."
Did you tell him you did?
No.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
What's wrong?
"Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up."
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
Just a shower?
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
"Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me."
"Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her."
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
You know what I'm saying here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
I don't have a girlfriend.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Yeah.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Raw deal.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Of course.
"So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back."
I'm on duty.
You thirsty?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Better than one.
Two heads.
I'll call it... tails.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Stay here.
My folks are.
You're Polish?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This isn't homicide school.
"I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something."
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Hmmmm.
Pretty.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
I don't even watch TV.
"Nah, why should you?"
"Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff."
"Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit."
"Nah, I musta missed it."
Watch the news?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
"No, what is it?"
"You know what that is, right?"
"No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?"
"Then do it, asshole."
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Don't be late.
Thank you.
See you later.  Good luck.
Okay.
"Yeah, yeah.  Good thing."
Yeah.  I promise.
You promise?
Tonight.
"Okay, til tonight."
I love you.
"Patronizing you... Nay, I love you."
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Promise?
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
"Well, that's great."
Yeah.
That's good.
Answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Could be Leon's.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
"Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?"
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
I'm not.
"Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me."
Stop it.
"Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh..."
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Hey.
"Hey, honey."
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
"Eddie, are you okay?"
"Alright, cut, cut, cut."
Do you have the suspect in custody?
"He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine."
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Is it drug related?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
There are two bodies found at this point.
How many victims are up there?
"Detective, does it look like a murder?"
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Any chance we can do that again?
"Yeah, yeah.  Jesus."
Okay.  You ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Ready?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
That's unique.
Not what.  Who.
So what's unique?
How old are your kids?
I'm not moody.
"I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie."
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Jesus Christ.
No.  Are you proposing?
Are you married?
Dog food.
And what do you do with the bones?
You stuff sausage in it.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I am butcher.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where's your partner?
Get down on your knees.
You'll be my first.
"Tommy, take a walk."
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Give me the address!!
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
"I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?"
Where's Czech girl?
"Hi, I'm Honey."
He doesn't speak English.
"I'd like to speak for himself, okay?"
Two weeks.
How long are you planning to stay?
We are both from Prague.
Is there a problem?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Yes.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
"Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!"
I have five-hundred dollars.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks holiday.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes sir.
"Next.  Could I see your documents, please?"
Yes.  Both.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
"In here, says he wants a million."
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Who is he?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Traitor!!
"No, I don't get that!"
You got that?
Credit?
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Be quiet.  Watch.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Shut up.  Look!
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
"In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?"
Cut!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Good idea!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Sit down!
Let me get a shot of it.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
What is that?
"Put the camera down, Oleg."
Why not?
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is it?
Don't want to film this?
"Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!"
Does it hurt?
Shut up.
"Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!"
"Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?"
Get in the bathroom!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whore?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
How you erase this?
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
Turn that fucking thing off!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
What?
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
We have no money.  Come on.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Don't speak Russian!
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
I want to document my trip to America.
Did you hear what I said?
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
"We started over, you can too."
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
It's easy to learn.
As a plumber?!
"Yes, the money is good."
A job?
I can get you a job.
Ha. Ha.
We spent it!
Milos.  Get my money!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
Surprise!  Surprise!
Emil???!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
"Trust me, you'll want to take this call."
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
"And you, you'll pay for what you did!"
"Paulie, you've got kids, right?"
Yeah?
In love?  With who?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Isn't he a little moody?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright.  Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
"Well, he..."
I know.
Excuse me?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
I'm here for movies.
What are you coming here to do?
A cheap hotel.
New York.
I speak English.
Yes...he's my friend.
"Well, he killed my partner!"
He's my collar!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
No way!  He's mine!
I'll take him.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
What was that?
"Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight."
That's what it looks like to me.
"So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?"
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
No.  Go ahead.
You okay?
I'll send a cop back for you.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
"Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?"
"Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?"
"Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!"
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
"Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you."
Yeah?  What kind?
I used an accelerant.
How did you start the fire this time?
"What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter."
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
What the hell happened?
Get outta here!
Not good.
How was it?
"Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby."
"It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!"
"Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!"
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Aren't you tired?
"You hear that question, Garcia?"
How long they been livin' here?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Yeah?
What?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What??
He knew all along.
"But you knew that, right?"
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Don't blow your nose!
Clean?
"Mouth's clean, too."
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
"Oh yeah, why?"
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
"I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?"
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
"Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!"
"Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood."
"Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy."
Don't stoop to his level!
What are you gonna do?
The clerk?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
"We're in negotiations, that's correct."
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
"Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?"
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Your doctor?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
CONTINUED
"I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this."
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
She's wonderful.
CONTINUED
"I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to."
CONTINUED
"Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful."
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Roger.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I guess not.
"I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy."
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
It's the last one.
Yes.
Hal?
Two more.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
No.
You're kidding.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
"Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?"
Are you reasonably awake?
Good morning. How's it going?
"Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry."
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
"Yes, I don't know what to make of it."
"Well, that's something."
"Still, all we have to do is ask Hal."
I guess it isn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
But not completely inconceivable?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
"Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us."
That's true.
How?
"Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now."
"Yes, I thought so."
That seems very unlikely.
"No, as a matter of fact, I didn't."
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Oh?
"I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation."
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
"No. I never did, either."
"Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?"
It's possible.
Yes.
Really.
"Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem."
Yes?
It's about my salary cheques.
What's up?
"Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying."
"Sure, what is it?"
"Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something."
"Okay, come on down."
Okay.
Right. Just a sec.
"Hi. Frank... coming in, please."
I am prepared to do that anyway.
"Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you."
"Hal, switch to manual hibernation control."
"I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please."
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
"Yes, it is."
"Too bad about Frank, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is, Hal."
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
And don't you worry about it.
"Well, don't worry about it."
"I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal."
"Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on."
"Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?"
You probably also know that we found them okay.
"Yes, I know."
"Sure, Dave, what's up?"
"Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something."
"The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours."
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
"What is it, Hal?"
"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem."
He's got a point.
CONTINUED
"Still, you really don't believe it, do you?"
CONTINUED
"Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?"
CONINUED
"Well, what is it?"
CONTINUED
Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED
"Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time."
CONTINUED
"Goodbye, Daddy."
"'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart."
"Yes, Daddy."
"Thank you, Daddy."
"Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow."
"Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called."
How many days until you come home?
"Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called."
She's in the bathroom.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
"One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?"
"In three days, darling, I hope."
When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
"Yes, I know that sweetheart."
I'm having a party tomorrow.
"I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?"
"I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?"
I'll bet it's a fortune.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
"Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic."
"Well, how's it going back there?"
Thank you.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you."
"No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going."
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
"Well, that does sound very odd."
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
"Well, where are all of you off to?"
How is gregor?
"Oh, that's such a delightful age."
And your charming little daughter?
"Yes, it's coming along very well."
"Yes, I think so. Just about then."
Fine.
"Well, shall we go through Documentation?"
"Yes, very pleasant."
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
"Please, it really doesn't matter."
"Well, thank you very much for being so understanding."
"How do you do, Mr. Miller?"
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Certainly.
"Well, I'm glad about that."
"Fortunately, they did."
"Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely."
I see.
That's right.
Really?
"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean."
"Yes,as a matter of fact, I am."
"Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?"
"Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon"
"Yes, really, thank you very much."
Are you quite sure?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Any ideas about the colour?
"Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice."
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
"Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?"
"No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern."
I see.
What do you mean?
Thank you.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
"Yes, Hal, what's up?"
Opening pod bay doors.
"Hal, check all airlock doors secure."
Roger.
"Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition."
I understand.
"Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit."
"Five by five, Frank."
Roger.
"Hal, have pod arms secure the component."
"Thank you very much, Hal."
That's true.
That's true
That's true.
That's true.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
True.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
"I will if I can, Frank."
"Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false."
"Great, just great."
How about chargin' the battery?
"We don't wash 'em, ya know."
"Yeah, I've been busy."
This is three years old.
Hammond.
Name?
I want to pick up my car.
Yeah?
"I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know."
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I don't give a shit who you ask.
"Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think."
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Now how's your memory doin'?
"No, man, I think I'll have a vodka."
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Vodka.
Yeah.
"Hey, what about me?"
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
I never paid for it in my life.
"Yeah, dummy.  Money."
Pay money?
Pros.
"Whaddya mean, buy?"
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I ain't tired yet.
I want to drive awhile.
"You got a real big mouth, convict."
"Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto."
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
"Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?"
"Here you go, baby."
"Hello, again."
"Here's hoping, baby..."
"Well, maybe I'll see you later ..."
What's the matter with my place?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
"Yeah, i been waiting three years."
You're in a hurry.
"Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way."
Goodbye.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
"Hey, what kind of talk is that?"
I'm candy...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Where's ganz?
No chance.
You're gonna help us take him.
"Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be..."
Would you guys...
I hear you've got visitors.
How about it?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You're done.  End of story.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
"After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever..."
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You lying son of a bitch...
Thanks.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
"That's right. Not my style, Reggie.."
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You okay?
"Well, you got to admit we come a long way."
Partnership?
"If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in."
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
"Hey, there she is..."
"If she's right, and if you don't screw up."
Do I get to kiss her too?
Don't worry about it.
"It's late, they're closing..."
"Yeah, but we didn't get 'em."
"Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down."
"Hey, how'd my car get here?"
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Luther's on the move...
Why?
"When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go."
That was quick.
"Yeah, I see her."
Yeah. Guess not.
"Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ..."
You sure that's the reason?
So you took the rest of the night off...
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
We missed.
What about Ganz?
What about Luther?
Hello. And goodbye.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Where's luther?
"I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?"
No way...
You stay with me...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
"That was in style a couple years back, man."
No class...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
"Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?"
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
"Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?"
"Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world."
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
What?
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
"You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time."
Shit.
You just drove by it.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
"You're a real case, you know that, Jack?"
Where's the goddamn car?
Yeah.  Right.
"Right, partner."
Where's the money?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
"Not likely, convict."
We split 50-50?
He's after your money.
Just tell me about the money.
Jesus.
Half a million.
How much?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
"One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story."
"They saved your ass, convict."
"Yeah, right.  You want to try again?"
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
"You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself."
Let's go.
Come on.
Must be billy's girl.
There.
"While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too."
"You made that move, huh?"
"Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer."
"That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control."
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
"I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge."
The bet's off.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
What are you talkin' about?
That's never been one of my problems.
"Hey, you wanna bet?"
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
"If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up..."
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Well?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
You have a good time?
Last night.
"Last night, two nights ago, three?"
I don't give out the details.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
"Now, where we goin', convict?"
"You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?"
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
"Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor."
"Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat."
We eat when I say we eat.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
"I think you better put him on ice, man."
What do you think?
Want to try it again?
Thank you.
"Hey, this works pretty good."
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
"I'm helpin' you, huh?"
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I may call you worse than that.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
"Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'."
"I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack."
"What gang you talkin' about, Jack?"
Luther was part of the gang?
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Yeah.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
No way to start a partnership.
"Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal."
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
"We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers..."
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I'll think about it.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Bullshit.
I got a lot to protect.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
You're crazy.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I noticed..."
"Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help."
You here to write my life story?
"Sure, anything you want."
"Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?"
"You got a name, cop?"
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I didn't have the time.
What a screw-up.
You couldn't get to him?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Which one pulled the trigger?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
How did they get away?
"I lost them, that's what happened."
What the bell happened?
I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah?
Jack?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah...
"Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back."
"Yeah, I read the report..."
"Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report."
"The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?"
Yeah.
"That's what you say, Cates..."
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
What?
I got to wait for a call.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Bullshit red tape.
Nothing.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Doesn't look like it.
"Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong."
So do you...been a long day.
You look awful.
One of  em's in the slam.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
"Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?"
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Who are all these?
Billy Bear...
Shit.
I'll help you out.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
When? How?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I don't know.
"Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie."
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
A cop...
That's what I always say.
You're impossible...
Tell me.
"Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind..."
Where is he?
Three more hours...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
"Let's go, Reggie."
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Whaddya think?
"Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out."
"Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend."
So what?
"Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party."
"Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian..."
How do you know?
"I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian."
You real down?
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
"Hiya, kid."
"Hey, I don't believe it."
Fuck you.
"Hi, it's me..."
Hello.
"Just a second, that's all!"
"Jack, wait..."
"Elaine, I gotta put you on hold..."
Jack?  What was that?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
So am I.
"No, it's I'm just surprised you called."
No wonder you're so popular.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
"I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?"
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
"Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun..."
"Jack, are you okay?"
"Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day..."
You made the front page.
"Yeah, one of my favorites."
Great place for lunch.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Thanks for the coffee.
"Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure..."
You sure you want me to?
Call me later.
"That's the way I see it, too."
"You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless."
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
"Hey, you know what I really think?"
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I guess he got the message...
What'd you do?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What's wrong with that?
I'm all wet.
"That's the way I see it, too."
You're hopeless.
"Hey, you're right."
I still don't think it's loaded.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
"I don't answer questions, I ask 'em..."
What am I wanted for?
That's no bull.
"Hey, two days with him is enough."
How would you know?
Hard man to live with.
"Shrink major, not a shrink."
Who the hell are you?
"Alright, I'm coming...hold on."
Keep stallin'.
What do you want?
Stall.
Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
Hey...
"Sure, right."
"We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?"
"Yeah, old times."
We got a lot to talk about.
Can't complain.
How ya doin'?
"Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature."
How hot are they?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
"Rosalie, you okay?"
"First, the money."
Let her go.
"Come on, you can trust me. Please."
You chickenshit punk...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
When?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
"Billy, go ahead, break it..."
"Don't give me this, we were partners."
"Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me..."
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
"Surprise, Luther."
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Try and take it.
Give it back.
This ain't a credit business.
Five.  On credit.
Five bills.
Don't mess with me. How much?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
How much?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How about some ammo?
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
You sure?
"Naw, right here's okay."
You want to go outside?
"Not bad, not bad."
"How you doing, man?"
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.

When is she not in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are you doing?
Of course.
Good luck..

What kind of mission?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
That's what I thought.
"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!

Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

Is there anything that can stop it?
And then?
"Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important."
One more reason to shoot first eh?
"Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!"
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

"Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me."
"I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?"
"I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?"

I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Is that all?
"Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!"
What did you say? What did you do?
"Solid little jobs, aren't they?"
Fuck it! Hold tight!
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
It's like a cab isn't it?
You know how to fly this thing?
I'll be right back.
"Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?"
Not without Leeloo.
"Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?"
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
He's on vacation.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Got it...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
"Yeah, very big, a giant."
I don't think this is a good time...
"I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own."
Crystal.
Uh... not really.
Does it get any better or what!
...Hi.
"Oh, yes you will..."
Three of us will never fit in there!
I thought you were divorced.
It's my wife.
What is it?
...Shit!
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Why not?
I'm not going.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I've had enough good news for today
Don't you open your messages?
You're the only one left alive...
And the third one?
Just one... why me?
Where have I heard this song before?
To save the world.
What mission?
I love you...
Tell me...
Because...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Exactly.
...Like love...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
I want to sleep... forever...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I'm so tired...
"It's up to you now, Angel!"
...The rain falls...
"I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones."
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Protect life... Until death.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
"Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?"
I'm so very sad.
You're nothing but a... a...
It's difficult.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
"No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!"
Where you going?
"OK, you can turn around!"
You noticed..
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You get that off the screen?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Here we go again...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
Uh...
"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?"
Apipoussan?
Apipoussan!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
All 900.
Which one?
Learning language.
Finished what?

Thanks..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Uh..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Been here long?
The cash man!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
"Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center."
An elephant couldn't crack it.
This thing solid?
Wonderful!
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Talk English Doc.
Have you identified it?
Actually only one cell survived..
This is all that survived?
How much time is left?
They just landed in the desert.
"Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one."
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
"I'm about to, Mr. President."
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Gentlemen?
Recommendations.
Wait or act.
Options.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
"Perfect, Mr. President."
Is that better?
"I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you ."
"Staedert, do you read me?"
To fame.. salud..
Drink!
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Amen..
"Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much.."
I'm not at the hotel!
"Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel."
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
"Yes, Sir!"
"Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?"
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
...I can't wait to be among you.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
How's our deal coming along?
Got it.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
"...Not far, now."
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Am I disturbing you?
I just talked to her.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
Tom... she's dead.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
What?
Mrs. Christian.
Who are you calling?
Amy...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Don't...
You're killing me...
I don't know what to say
"Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us."
You should have.
"No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!"
You don't understand...
You couldn't?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Tom...
"What's going on, Tom?  What happened?"
"I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?"
What happened to you?
"Just do it, Amy, please, go."
... What's going on?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
"Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully.."
Hello?
Why the gun?
I know.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I understand.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
I love you.
I love you.
"Honey, I'm not, please..."
"You better not be smoking, that's all I can say."
How's the detective business?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
"Okay, I believe you."
"Well, I'm not smoking, okay?"
I'm not accusing you...
Your clothing reeks of it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Do you know how much I missed you?
Welcome home.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
"What you see is what I got, mister."
Snuff?
There's nothing harder.
Anything harder?
"Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free."
What are these?
I promised him to Machine.
What the fuck... !
Nobody knows anything.
Dino...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
I'm telling you...
Bullshit.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
"I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city..."
"Bring the film, or we kill him."
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
"Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go..."
Friend of yours?
I remember him.
"You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?"
"Look, I don't know what this..."
"Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully."
Take out your gun!
What are you... ?
Sure.
"Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?"
What are these for?
They should be here any minute.
Where are the women?
Excellent.
Right here.
You brought the money?
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Where's that?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Machine's in?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
"You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?"
I'm camera shy.
What's the problem?
I'd rather you didn't.
We can do that.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
"If it's not him, there's no deal."
Machine.
I'll consider it.
I want to watch you work.
And they are?
Is it?
That's five thousand dollars.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
You said something about money.
Hmm.
A fellow investor.
"Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?"
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
What can I do for you today?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You betrayed us.
"You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?"
"First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles..."
... sorry...
Fuck off.
Leave him alone.
You're a dead man.
"Move it, dirtbag... !"
"Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed."
Is that him?
It's good what you're doing.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Any good?
"Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry."
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
"I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me..."
I'm not so sure about this.
Why don't they come to me?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
We do.
I figured you share information.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
"Alright, Tom."
Call me Tom.
"What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?"
I never killed anyone.
Easy enough for you.
Don't think I won't.
Do it.
Where?  Show me where.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Show me where you buried her.
You got absolute zero.
Stop talking.
Keep moving.
Show me.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
What did you do with her body?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
"What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop..."
Tell me what happened.
You enjoy it?
Because we're going there.
Why?
What the fuck do you want from me?
"What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?"
Something like that.
It was a lot of fucking money.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
"Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker."
How much did he pay you?
Yeah.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
"Yeah, the fucking lawyer."
"I told you, I don't know."
I want his name.
I don't know...
Who is Machine?
What do you want?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Fuck you!
Don't ask questions.
How'd you find me here?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I'm gonna kill you.
"One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had..."
What's he talking about?
What the fuck are you.. ?
"You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago..."
Who is this.
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
"Yeah, who's this?"
Eddie.
Celebrity Films.
Fuck you!
"Look, you cocksucker..."
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
He's lying.
Give me the film.
You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.
Fuck you.
You almost went over your limit.
Enlighten me.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
"Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?"
I'm asking.
You're asking me why?
You're making me very angry.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut up.
"Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her."
"Except, you're willing commit murder with them."
They're no friends of mine.
Never mind how I found you.
I was well compensated.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's right.
You are a private investigator?
Of what sort?
I'm listening.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
What's this?
Nope.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's next?
"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""
You don't need to be here.
"Who is he, his name?"
"I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players..."
Who is he?
"Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?"
Wha... ?
"Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?"
Great.
It's their Presidential Suite.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
See ya.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
"Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses."
"I'm a working stiff, pops."
"Alright, I get the picture."
Where does he sell it?
You're learning.
Specialty product.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Good question.
A daughter.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
What about me?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
"I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?"
"I don't know, where are yours?"
Where are your parents?
Twenty-five.
How old are you?
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Snuff films.
Child pornography.
Interesting theory.
"Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight."
... Hello... ?
"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
"Tomorrow night, I get off at eight."
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
"Sounds good, pops."
"Four hundred a week, off the books."
How much do you make now?
How much?
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Not quite.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
I'm not a cop.
There's not much illegal.
Max.
"What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Three, four years."
How long you been working there?
Good for you.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
"Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would."
Remember me?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Truman Capote.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
I'll risk it.
"Well, it's tempting, but no thanks."
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Pardon me?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Yeah... guess so.
Big date tonight?
How will I get it to you?
Fine...
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
How are you?  Having any luck?
"Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here."
Hello?
"You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian."
"You told me to look, so I looked."
Okay.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I'm here.
Hello... ?
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
You're joking.
"Okay, I follow you so far..."
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm not positive this means anything.
"My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash."
Okay...
Nothing remotely like this.
You've found missing persons before.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
It won't work like that.
You don't have any other choice.
"I told you I can't, not yet."
You... you need to go to the police.
"Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about."
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm telling you it's not that.
No.
I'm afraid I don't...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
"Cash, stock certificates, and this..."
Do you want to tell me what you found?
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Just curious.
"Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?"
He succeeded.
Pittsburgh?
I'll do whatever I can to help.
My condolences.
"As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now."
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
"He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here..."
He's odd.
Thank you.
"Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?"
"Uh huh, pleasure."
I try to be.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
No... no... no...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No...
Who are you?
Who is this... ?
"Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead."
What... ?
What are you talking about... ?
I remember.  You just left...
Hello... ?
It's been six years.
Yes.
Will you let me look?
How... how can you say that to me...?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
I don't know.  I think so.
Do you think the police did a good job?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
What?
You should be.
No.
Are you religious?
We're all like that.
Okay.
Of course.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I didn't mean to...
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
"September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared."
Yes.
I don't know.
What was she running from?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
No.
"I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV."
That's exactly what I am.
"They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?"
No.
Neil... Neil Cole.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
"Yes, but..."
"I don't understand, who are... ?"
"Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator..."
Yes... ?
I'll do what I can.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
"That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture."
Her belongings?
Those are her belongings.
What is this?
Do you know what happened to her?
Yes.  I remember her.
Yes... I remember Mary
"Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance."
"Yes, Mister Welles, thank you."
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
"No, sir, he is not."
"None too discreet, is he?"
"Certainly, sir."
Okay.  Fine.
"No, you may not."
"Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?"
Cash.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
"Okay, I'll take it all."
Then we'll stay up together.
We'll figure it out.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
I can't go back to sleep again.
"Yeah, or turn you into toast."
"It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake."
"Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's."
I can't find him.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
It was bad.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Kristen...
You alright?
What?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What's wrong?
"Alice, you think you can leave?"
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Rick...I can't.
"Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back."
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
I don't want to.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
What?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
"Kristen, what happened?"
You what?
"When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert."
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
"Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?"
Sounds like a game show host to me.
You could do worse.
"I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad."
"Yeah, I'm not so sure."
I'm sure they're around.
"Then you saw him, too?"
"That obvious, huh?"
You've been up all night?
What?
We have matching luggage.
"Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet."
I know.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
You in a hurry?
Save it for later.  Come on!
You look great!
"Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others."
What the hell was that?
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Here we are.
"You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before."
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
"It's okay, we're just about there."
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
You just feel sorry for me.
"Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you."
"He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him."
Who?
Then what else can we do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Is there something we can do?
Not really.
Three days.
How long have you been awake?
"The story is, the deaths you can't argue with."
"No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow."
"Look, you know why, you just don't believe me."
"Extra money, huh?"
I've been working double shifts.
Kristen's story really got to her.
"No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!"
"""In her dream""?"
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
"Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan."
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
"You're his sister, right?"
No...
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Enough of that crap.
It was Freddy.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
"Alright, I think I see salvation..."
"Rick, please."
About Freddy?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Been up with Alice.
She knew she was gonna die.
"Hey man, we're all sorry..."
Nice neighborhood.
So?
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Let me talk to you.
I don't get it.
"Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment."
"Hey, Rick!"
Earth to Alice...
T-T-Thanks Alice...
"Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy..."
"Honey, we went over this in therapy."
"I'm sorry honey, but..."
Your distraught.  It'll help...
What's wrong with me?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
"It's okay, babe.  We're with you."
I'll tell you later.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Oh God!  He killed them!
What is it?
"When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day."
What?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Something wrong with the stairs?
"Don't worry, honey"
"You don't get it, he's after me..."
You just stay put.  You need rest.
I gotta get out of here.
You had a nasty bump.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Feeling better now?
You're not taking my baby!
"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
"In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --"
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
"Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility."
"What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him."
"Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?"
"It's okay, Dan"
"Excuse us, dear."
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
But how...?
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
What do you mean?
"He's inside you, where he hides."
Where is he?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Mommy...?
"My friend, with the funny hand."
Who says I don't like you?
"Who said I...wait, what?"
She doesn't want me around
No...
Is that who you're waiting for?
Been having bad dreams.
"Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?"
How did you know that?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
My name is...
"It's lonely in there, in my room."
"Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?"
Huh?
Hey...wake up.
Me too.
There you go.  Love you.
You're right.
Yeah...I guess.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
About him?
"He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?"
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
"Okay, babe.  What's the matter?"
I know.
The tickets.
"Sorry, babe."
Jesus!  Don't do that!
"Hi, beautiful."
Now.
But Dad --
I've got to go.
Alice!
You disappointed in me?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Alice...
Very funny.
Sobering...
How was the meeting?
"Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand."
"I'm so sorry, honey..."
It's just across the park.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
"Thanks for everything, Dad."
To take a picture.
Where are we going?
Dad!
No.  A deal's a deal.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
He sure loves to stay awake.
So did Dan.
"You do good work, Alice."
But how are we gonna --
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
What?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
That's the only reason you're alive...
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Krueger is reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
"I really think you need to calm down now, okay?"
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Did everyone call everyone?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
"Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead."
"Yeah, before they revoke his diploma."
"Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan."
"No, the Dan part was nice..."
"Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl."
Had kind of a long night.
"Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile."
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
I don't understand.
No shit.
Poor woman...
"Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?"
But I've seen her grave.
Meaning?
That's their problem.
They think I'm nuts.
Then we'll find another way.
Where are you going?
I don't know!
"What, you named it already?"
My baby!
Who's Jacob?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Nobody thinks that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Mark!
Then get out!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I thought about that.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
"Mark, are you okay?"
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I've got to write some of this down.
Well we gotta do something!
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
"Greta, come on.  One burger with me?"
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
"Give up, Mark, it's hopeless."
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Who?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
"That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place."
"Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career."
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
My undying love.  Have some.
"Next life.  Oh, what's that?"
"Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?"
All of us.  Right?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I want to talk about the baby.
"Stop saying that, it's bullshit."
"Have another one, sounds like you need it."
Yeah...
Makes you look like a nun--
These things are wild...  What do you think?
He invited me to his house last night.
"You, too?"
"Stick around, please?"
It's okay.
I can't listen to this.
Mark...
Faint.
Vomit?
"Two hours a day, six days a week."
"And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?"
I don't know.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Yes?
I'd sooner swim!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
"You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?"
"That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!"
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
"Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital."
My father!  He's not - ?
Your 'out.'  This came for you.
What is it?
You could train someone else.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
How is he - ?
"It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago."
"What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?"
Dave - !
Oh it does???
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Well?
We'll have to look for them later.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Somewhere down there?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
The sound again?
You hear that?
"Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon."
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Listen!  Hear that?
Yeah?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
I think you're right.
"Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!"
"You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look."
'Us?'
"You've got to let us try, Skipper --"
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
We're stuck tight!
Cyclops?
"'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!"
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
A lot of people think like that.
So?
I guess.
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Huh?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
"So they caught up with you, too?"
Reef!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
We hope!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
"With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --"
The frogmen?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
"What course, Skipper?"
What???
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Course and speed?
I...don't know!
What about down?
Seems to be all around...
Is there any way out of it?
"Right, Skipper."
What????
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Why do you say that?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Something wrong?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
"All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor."
"Yes, Griff?"
"Excuse me, Skipper---"
What about time...?
Anything ---
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Now they feel it...down below.
Wonderful!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
All ready?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
There's got to be an explanation!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
"...above Murmansk, and Finland."
"High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions..."
Under <u>water</u>?
Minus three.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
"Nothing we can do, now."
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What?
"Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?"
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
But - what can we accomplish?
That's what I said!
Right <u>at</u> him?
Thirty-four seconds!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
After torpedo room:  Report!
"Determine extent of damage, immediately."
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
What do you think?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Huh?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Who with?
"I met Dr. Kent, once."
"Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper."
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Obviously.
"To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?"
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Why?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
He did!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Swell!
- for horrors like yourself?
"Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?"
That's a <u>face</u>???
Come where?
"Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!"
All right - go to it.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
"Due north.  At five knots...no, six!"
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
"Or, perhaps, until he gets us?"
"Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!"
I'll be another!
"Well, I'll be - !"
See what?
Thank you.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
No.
Twombley involved?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
"This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?"
"As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere."
Has anybody offered to buy it?
You don't believe me?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
"You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?"
Who?
"Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him."
Who?
Always has been.
"Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town."
"Are you alright, Wade?"
No. Black.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
"You got yourself a computer, Alma."
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Chub says you're fired.
Tell me.
Yeah. I know about that.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Same old shit.
What are you boys up to?
Oh.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Yes.
"It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?"
This spring.
How soon?
I plan to. Soon.
That was me.
We bought you.
You can't buy Wade off.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
He's on to us!
"No, of course not. Just say it, that's all."
"Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?"
"Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me."
You see it?
Yeah.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You heard the news.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Deers have ears too.
Sun's gettin high.
This way.
Yeah.
Safety on?
What happened?
Hmm.
They said.
Really.
"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."""
Oh.
Double A. New Britain.
You played for the Sox?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Yeah?
I used to play ball.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I'm okay.
Wonderful!
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Mmm.
"You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine."
You think so.
You might not kill it.
Yeah.
If you get it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Damn straight!
"Guaranteed, eh?"
"It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid."
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
Open the door. We're late.
"Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?"
"Open the door, will ya?"
Lawford?
I'm fucking out of here.
He sure as hell won't.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Yeah.
"Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man."
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Saw him do it?
What?
Sure you did.
"Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said."
"Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?"
On your sleeve.
What blood?
Where'd you get the blood?
Yeah.
You stayed away?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
"A half mile in, along the old lumber road."
"No, I mean whereabouts."
In the chest.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Piece of fucking cake.
Shit.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Right!
"Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him."
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Like you and Gordon?
How'd you get the job?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Not here.
"Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?"
I thought I told you to move that truck!
"Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?"
No brag. Just fact.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Don't mind if I do.
"Okay, let's go home, then."
I want to go home.
"Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened."
Oh.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
You're a policeman.
I know.
"That's illegal, you know."
You can't.
I want to go home.
What are you sorry for?
"Please don't cry. Please, honey."
Fine.
Okay.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
"I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though."
"Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --"
"You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?"
Nothing.
"What do you want, then?"
No.
How about a Big Mac?
Oh.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Pop?
It belongs to Pop.
It's pretty old.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Are we going in this?
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Dad.
"That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here."
Yes.
Yes.
"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."
Yes.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
"Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?"
"See, I knew you'd be mad."
"Jesus, why?"
Yes.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I called Mommy.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
No what?
No.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
It's fun.
It's stupid.
What then?
It's not that.
I don't want to.
"Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know."
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I just think you used to be bad.
What are you talking about?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
But it's not funny now.
To us it was.
Was it funny?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I guess they're stupid.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Break stuff?
You know.
Do what?
Why do they do that?
I don't care. They're out.
Those are the Hoyts.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Yeah.
"The key, Wade."
"Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys."
Could be.
You and Mel Gordon?
Maybe.
I won't. You interested?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Want to buy?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
You? Why?
So?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
What do I have to do for it?
On what you pay me?
"You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?"
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
"I'm fine, fine."
"How you holding up, Wade?"
Yeah. A few things.
Something bugging you?
"It ain't done, if that's what you mean."
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Like hell.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
"Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."
You mean Twombley?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
"Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume."
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
I figured you already heard.
Huh?
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
What's the hurry?
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Fuck you.
I'm not saying that.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Don't go playing policeman.
Huh?
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Where's the plow?
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
"Tomorrow, Gordon."
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
"No problem. Look, I..."
Hi honey.
See. Get your boots.
"Yeah, lots."
It's just...
"We've done all our talking, Wade."
We should talk.
"No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far."
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
"I don't want her to go, Lillian."
"She's grown up some, hasn't she?"
Yeah.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Where's Jill?
Lillian!
I still don't understand --
Mel Gordon.
Good. Who?
I know who it is.
Did you get his number?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
"Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?"
"Don't be silly. Hi, Jill."
"Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that."
"Going somewhere, Margie?"
"I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?"
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
"Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry."
What happened?
Wade.
This is nuts.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
How?
Of course! I would've heard.
Think they're alright?
Strange.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I know your parents.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Good.
Alright. I'll think about it.
You've been married twice --
"I've been thinking about it, that's all."
"Oh, Wade."
Then... I guess you have to.
It's nice.
What way?
You knew me as a kid.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
But not now.
"You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money."
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
"Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?"
Jack doesn't need money.
Money.
"I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did."
"There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually."
Okay.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Call me.
Yeah. I mean that.
You don't mean that.
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Said what?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
"See you tomorrow, maybe."
Okay. She's fine.
How's she doing?
For a while.
"New hat?  Jill's up, I see."
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Can --?
It makes me sad.
Is...? She's dead then?
When did she die?
Coffee's perked.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
You're not using it today?
There's a furnace.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
"Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --"
"Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon."
Hold on!
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
What the hell are you talking about?
"I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'"
How's that?
"Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead."
"Can't it wait, then?"
"Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal."
Something about my father?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
"I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?"
Who are you?
He got his deer yet?
"Well, I guess -- that's what he said."
His office. You mean my old office.
"It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub."
"Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?"
Where... how'd you hear that?
The other guy.
Jack?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
You talked to Jack?
Marg! You got orders!
Marg!
This town sucks.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
What?
It don't look right.
"Take care, Wade."
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Crawl!
You and me.
Bang!
Yeah.
Everything you know is from me.
Call it what you want.
Love! I'm made of love!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
"You think you can take me now? Come on, try."
"Pop, for Christ's sake!"
"Listen, it's no big deal, Pop."
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
In the living room.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Yeah.
She's coming.
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Sleeping.
"Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?"
You no-good pup!
Nothing.
"What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!"
Atta-go.
Just do it.
Rolfe.
For what?
"Wade, are you alright?"
That's what you think.
"Well, I never heard that one."
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
"It may have happened, but not the way you said."
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
"I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened."
Yeah.
"I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?"
"Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?"
Not particularly.
A hunting accident is perfect.
I don't know. You tell me.
Money.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
"Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt."
Then who shot him?
That it wasn't an accident.
Which is?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Find them everywhere.
Want to know what I think happened?
"I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks."
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
"Well, do you still plan to get married?"
What about her?
What about Margie?
Yeah. I forgot.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
"Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess."
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Get some sleep.
"Yeah, I guess."
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
"A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill."
What happened?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Who?
How was she?
The night before the shooting.
Huh?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
"Well, it was an accident."
You think Jack shot him?
No shit.
Twombley.
Who?
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Wade?
Rolfe.
Jim... for godsake!
"Daddy. Daddy, please..."
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Yes dear?
Mom?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
That's not really the point.
Some kids were teasing you?
Your father never means to be so...
"No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?"
"I'm sorry, honey."
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
"I know, Mom.  It was great... really."
Back at The Fishbowl?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
"Mom, just this once, give it a rest."
Alice...
"Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream."
Don't you even want to ask?
I'm sure he's busy.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
"Yeah, no duh."
"Well, you aren't the President, dear."
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
"You are a resilient man, Mr."
He didn't leave us.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
"Fuck off, you stupid asshole."
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
"No, thank you. The gunfire did that."
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
I don't drink coffee.
"Okay, I'm slowing us down."
There they are!
"It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay."
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
"Been better, Dad... You?"
"How you doing, sweetie?"
Alice... I...
Daddy...
Daddy...
Alice!
How `bout a hug for the old man.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How was...  ...the ballet?
"Hey, you guys back already?"
"Oooooh, I'm good."
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Did we warn them off?
"cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out."
It's cut.
"Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here."
"Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up."
Got it.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
"Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here."
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Lemme take a look.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
"Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in."
"Uh, we got a problem here."
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
"How we doing, Colonel?"
Stay cool.
Got it.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
I'm doing what I can.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
He's busy being dead.
Put your pilot on.
You read my mind.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
"U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One."
I prefered the terrorists.
This doesn't make sense.
They aren't answering their hails.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
"Walter, if you have a point, make it."
We don't know that.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
"It was a good ad-lib, sir."
"Sir, you threw out page two."
To swear you in as President.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
"If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage."
But they start executing hostages in
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Can we do that?
"Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?"
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
My loyalty was never to my country.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Because it is my duty.
Why?
"Yes, Mr. President."
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Ga get it.
That's affirmative.
Roger.
"Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots."
"Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP."
About goddamn time.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Where are we now?
"Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq."
We're not going to make it.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
How?
Well it worked.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
why did they do that?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
A secret service agent. It must be.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Who did this?
Any of us?
Nine.
How many others killed?
Dead.
The rest of the secret service?
"Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States."
We've already been inspected.
"Copy, Air Force One."
"Tower, here."
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Stand by.
"Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over."
"Tower, Air Force One has been boarded."
"Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell."
You're pointing a gun at me.
Scared. We're scared.
"How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?"
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
"And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell."
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
*                     Please tell me your name.
Thank you.
And all these rooms here?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
"A dubious distinction, no?"
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Three...
Jim...
Four...
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Say something dear.
No.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
"So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one."
That was war.
How can you? I mean they're people.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Yes
Do you have to be so brutal?
My husband is a very courageous man.
I know he left you behind.
What do you know of my husband?
Leave my daughter alone.
"Come on, Alice."
"Now, or he dies, please."
What do you want with us?
"Hold on, Alice."
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
There goes your ride.
One thing I've learned as
"The taste of defeat is bitter, no?"
"Someday, you'll regret my nature."
Good. Good.
"Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone."
You'll do it?
Stop.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Over my dead body.
"Finally, we can bargain."
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Twenty minutes?
That isn't necessary.
"Sir, we stay with the President."
"Yes, sir."
I'll not going without my family.
Got it.
"Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide."
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
"We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back."
Gravity.
They've gotta be joking.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Flying the plane.
What are you doing?
Both of you.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Please... don't start with me.
I don't know why you stayed.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
"Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign."
How did your speech go?
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
"I'll make it up to you, I promise."
I wish it were that easy...
"But that's the point, Jim. We're right here."
I miss you. And I miss her.
What?
You know what?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
"Rose, I don't have time for this."
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
"No, Mr. President.  It can't."
Can't it wait?
May I speak to you for a moment?
"Actually, sir, you could be that someone."
Someone should give you a raise.
White House Situation room.
Where are we sending it?
"No. I thought about this, Mr."
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
"Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?"
"But this is different, sir. You're the President."
and if that means negotiating...
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
Did they say anything about my family?
Two... THREE. GO!
But...
One.
"We're handling it, sir."
Where's my family?
We're under attack.
What's going on?
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Thank you for calling the white House...
"Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the...."
"Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?"
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
"Yeah, right."
This is the President.
who can I say is calling?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
WE'RE HOOKED!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
IT'S OPEN!
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Twenty-five years.
"How long's it been since you flew, sir?"
Shit.
"Iraq? Shep, you're fired."
"Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq."
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Sir...
Shepherd.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
"Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?"
"Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?"
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
"Yes, sir."
That's my job.
You give me ulcers.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
"I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please."
Did we tape the Duke game?
It's bait.  Don't take it.
"Other way around, sir."
I might still have a few chips left.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
"No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?"
You wanna knock of f?
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
"Commissioner, Aquarius."
"Kruger, Sagittarius."
"I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner."
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
What's the story?
I was reading too.
Forget it.  I was reading.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
That just doesn't make any sense.
"That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago."
I just wish it was that simple.
What?
Commissioner.
"Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing."
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
"What is it, Mary?"
"Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?"
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes I did...
Did you feel that?
You better take this.
Sir?
Dunn.
"Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four."
"You better check it, Unger."
"We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir."
Accelerators down.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Oveur.
"Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand."
"Ted, the lever!"
Compute!
Now!
Set!
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
"Not when I'm with you, Ted."
Are you afraid?
"What will happen to him, Ted?"
That's right -- premature ejection.
You mean...
Simon just ejected!
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
"I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will."
"That was very well put, Ted."
I mean until we start to burn up.
"Not now, Elaine."
"Ted, we've only got ten minutes."
"Ted, please be careful."
"Ted, there's no time to explain."
"Elaine, what's going on?"
Ted!
Elaine!
"Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone."
I'd use the word insane.
"The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick."
"What word would you use, Elaine?"
"I've never used the word insane, Ted."
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
"Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital."
"We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over."
"Elaine, we have to go back."
Elaine.
Ted!
"Not now, Elaine!"
Ted.
"I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!"
"What are you doing, Ted?"
"Let me by, Elaine."
"Ted, we're taking off!"
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted!  What are you...?
"Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you."
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
If that's the way you want it.
"No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go."
"His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says."
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
"Who's that, Ted?"
"Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better."
"Elaine, what happened to us?"
"Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself."
Elaine.
There's nothing wrong with me!
"Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground."
Ask Simon.
"Ted, what's wrong?"
"I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why."
"But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out."
It's got to be stopped!
"That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk."
Te...!
Elaine.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
"Is he making any progress, Doctor?"
"The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine."
"Is that a good sign, Doctor?"
I mean for Ted.
"You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol."
"What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?"
"Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor."
"Simon, what are you saying?!"
Maybe.
My career is shot.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Can't we change course?
"Simon, what's happening?!"
Roger.
"Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit."
That's my girl.
I think so.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Don't be too long.
So mentally ill?
"Simon, why has he become so... so..."
"No, I've been excited before."
I guess this is a first for you.
"I'm so excited, Simon."
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Simon.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
"No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit."
"I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine."
"You can do it from up here, Captain."
Roger.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
"I don't think we have any alternative, Captain."
"Yes, sir."
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Request; life support systems check.
"Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I..."
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
You have great tits.
Go ahead.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
"That's okay, ROK."
"Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago."
That's not possible.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Negative.
"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze."
"No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?"
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
"Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?"
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
"We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury."
"Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?"
"Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?"
Yeah.
He's a boy dog.
Sure.
Can I hold him?
Scraps.
"Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?"
What...?
All right.  Here.
I don't want to hear that word!
"Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency."
I'm sure.
You're sure?
What?
I don't want to live anymore.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
"Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it."
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
"All right, Captain Oveur.  Over."
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
"Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over."
No.  Poached.  Over.
"How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over."
"A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over."
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
What should I say?
A b...
He's carrying a bomb.
"Sixteen 'C', why?"
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
"Whenever your're ready, Captain."
"Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn."
"Good to be aboard, gentlemen."
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
"Mr. Kurtz, I presume."
Captain Oveur?
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
"Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it."
"It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work."
Yes.
"Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?"
"Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays."
You folks need any help?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Don't try to stop me!
You can't go in there!
"Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock."
"All right, it's a matter of death."
"You'll have to be more specific than that, sir."
"No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death."
"Do you have an appointment, sir?"
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Then Elaine was right.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
"Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?"
Striker.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
"You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications."
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
"You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker."
"That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return."
Are you on the Mercury mission?
"Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time."
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
No.  I mean your relationship.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Do you want to talk about it.
"I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it."
You've been hurt.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
"Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?"
"Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing."
No. I'm all alone.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
"Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer."
"Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to."
"No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation."
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
"No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men."
Thank you. Cream?
"Ah, won't you sit down?"
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
"I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee."
"Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here."
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
"Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there."
"Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out."
"Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land."
George Zipp said that?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Surely there must be something you can do.
"I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time."
"Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?"
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
"Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?"
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Surely you can't be serious.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Both pilots!
"What is it, Doctor? What's happening?"
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well...not for another two hours.
Can't you take a guess?
I can't tell.
"Captain, how soon can we land?"
No. No one that I know of.
Well...
No.
"Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?"
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
"Just how serious is it, doctor?"
"He had fish, too."
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
He had fish.
What did he have?
"Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna."
"Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish."
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Certainly.
A hospital? What is it?
"Yes. Yes, of course."
That's right.
Uh-huh.
"See them, Elaine?"
The gear is down.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Yes?
Ted...
"But Ted, you're the only..."
"What happened, Ted? What went wrong?"
Rats! I've lost number three.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice!
And a little ice.
Rain.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
What's his problem?
"Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately."
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Headquarters!? What is it?
You got a telegram from head≠quarters today.
"That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine."
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
I love you.
"I love you, Elaine."
"Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much."
What's the matter?
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
"Elaine, I've got to talk to you."
"Ted, what are you doing here?"
But if you'll just give me...
You expect me to believe that?
"Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change."
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Ted!
Elaine!
"Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can."
"I think so, but I've never seen it so acute."
Airsick?
Who wants to be first?
"Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight."
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
We'd better get back now.
Hello.
We have a visitor.
"Good-bye, darling."
"Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling."
"Good-bye, darling."
"Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill."
"So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself."
"Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time."
"Good-bye, darling."
Every day.
You promise you'll write.
"Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much."
"All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner."
He's right on the heading.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
"Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind."
Did you decide on a runway yet?
"Yes, Captain?"
Here.
"Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up."
"How ya doing, honey?"
What is it?
"Oh, I can't stand it."
"Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped."
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
"Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!"
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
"...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs."
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
"Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner."
"I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?"
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
"Okay, this is one of my favorites."
"Oh, I'd love to."
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
"I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!"
I'm Randy.
Hi!
"Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?"
"Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?"
Yes?
"I will, but Jim won't."
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
"All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock."
"No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here."
"No, why don't you take care ot it?"
"Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?"
"Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?"
"We have clearance, Clarence."
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
"Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock."
Of course.
"Oh yes, I saw. Poor child."
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Yes?
"Excuse me, Sister?"
"Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here."
"Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready."
"Would you go up, please?"
The cockpit? What is it?
No. No thank you.
"Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?"
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
"Do you feel all right, sir?"
Thank you.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Yeah...
You okay?
"Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes."
I like my horizons narrow.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
"The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows."
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Show me.
In there.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
"We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--"
That's right.
You are Cassandra?
"Lay off, asshole."
"Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?"
You don't have squat.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
"No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity..."
"Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history..."
"Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic."
"I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department."
Yes...
William Harcourt?
Do it!
Here?
Kill them both.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
He didn't recognize me.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
You look very good.
How do I look?
You understand that.  But how many others will?
But there's no more drug.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
We can't let him get away.
Tell me about it...
Harcourt is dead.
... It's Harcourt.
What is this?!
Do what?!  George-- ?!
No!  We must do this alone.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
"What's this about, George?  I know that look."
"With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now."
Ss-ai!
Shit!
Fuck procedure.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
"George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones..."
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
"Uh, George..."
"If the drug is here, we must destroy it."
"Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart."
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
"I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you."
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
We all did.
We?  You've taken it?
How potent?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
You must leave me alone on this.
Nothing.
What was that about?
Thank you.
Stop the car!
"Come on, you won't have to get near the water."
"Please, I must get out here."
Why?
Stop the car.
"Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!"
To the... to the beach?
"Well, let's roll, George."
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
"George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?"
She's going to divorce me.
Where'd you get this?!!
"Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?"
I'm going home.
"Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals."
"No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes."
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Your health...
In the other man's rectum.
"I appreciate your honesty, George."
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Was.  Divorced.
You are married?
Yeah... I know the routine.
My wife?  She worries about me.
"So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?"
I believe he is probably lying.
When will Strader return?
"We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch."
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Who is he?
"Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow."
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
This is mole.  It's good.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
"Yeah, sure.  I knew that..."
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
You know that guy?
Stay back!  I'm okay.
"Matthew, you don't have to-- ."
Your mother mates out of season.
Tell me.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Screw you.
I'll handle it.
But I-- .
"Back off, George."
"Uh, Matthew..."
"Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?"
At the end of the bar.
Who said that?
Why'd I do what?
Why did you do it?
"We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley."
"Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time..."
Did you talk to him?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Did you learn anything?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
"Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife."
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
How the hell do you know that?
And still it fits?
"Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches."
And that fits?
Get the picture?
What is this?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Nothing?
Nothing.
What's this?  What's going on?
"Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?"
"Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--"
"Well... yes, quite possibly."
What is wrong?
Yes.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
"Nice signal, dickwad!"
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Let's talk Hubley.
"Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?"
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
I am George.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
No... two.
Only holds five.
What is it?
"... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon."
That where Anderson worked?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Who else can I ask around here?
"We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?"
You think this is the guy who did it?
"Well, one of the men didn't like him so much..."
Sure.  Just a minute.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
"I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up..."
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
"For you, anything."
"Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?"
"That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else."
"Yeah, I heard of it."
What's that?
Ss'kya'ta'.
Did he find anything?
What kind of test?
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
"Yeah, I'll bet."
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah.
"You took this gut out, too, didn't you?"
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
The human?
"Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours."
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Don't tell me what to think.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
You?
Departmental policy.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
"Yeah, Sykes?"
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
I can't!  Do you mind!
Get outta there!
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
"Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too."
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
You got your vest?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
"Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--"
What?
How can I go?
It is.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
"Uh, seems to be in front and behind."
"Talk to me, Hudson."
Can't lock up...
Position?
Movement!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
"Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?"
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
"Would you, Sir?"
This floor's freezing.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
"Vasquez, take point.  Let's move."
"Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!"
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
"Okay, let's do it."
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
"Well, thanks, I --"
"You did okay, Bishop."
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Ripley...
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
HOW MUCH TIME?
See you soon.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
What?
I'll go.
And it's too late to shut it down?
How long until it blows?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
Could it be intelligent?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Yes.  That follows.
Sorry to disappoint you.
"Now, wait a second --"
Corporal Hicks!?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
"Don't make me pull rank, Ripley."
You son of a bitch.
Bullshit!
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
Why not?
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
She's right.
"Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built..."
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That the atmosphere processor?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That's the plan.  My word on it.
"Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi..."
"Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month."
If I go.
"Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?"
That's right.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
"Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial."
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Hear me out...
No.  There's no way!
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
"You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo."
I get the picture.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Amy.
Is she...?
"Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest..."
Have they located my daughter yet?
"Fifty-seven...oh, Christ..."
"Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there."
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
What's he scanning for?
It's insured.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
Dead on all channels.
Still nothing from the colony?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Forget it.
"All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I..."
How do you feel?
They're but off!  Do something!
I told them to fall back...
Shut up.  Just shut up!
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
So?  So?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So.
Proceed inside.
I don't know.
What is it?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
One of us?
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
"How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?"
You tell me.  I only work here.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Alive?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
"Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go."
"Sir, the CPU is on-line."
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
...We're coming in.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
"Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?"
What's the question?
"Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks."
"Yes, Hicks?"
Sir?
Fuckin' A!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's get these things lit.
Seventeen meters.
Do it!
The corner!  Ready?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
We got problems.
Aye-firmative.
Are you finished?  You okay?
"Not that tunnel, the other one!"
Let's get the fuck out of here!
"Sure, Hicks."
Save it.
"Don't be long, Ellen."
Ellen.
We ain't going anywhere.
"Hicks, don't let him leave."
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Stand back.
Locked.
We didn't miss anything.
"Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations."
It's game time.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
"Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself."
"Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that."
What's this?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
They'll get us.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Now many?
On my way.
They're in the approach corridor.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
About seventeen days.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Poor bastard.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
You're just reading me.
It's inside the complex.
"Hudson, give us a break."
"Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us."
"Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?"
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Fuck you.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
No.  Have you?
"Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?"
It's readin' right.  Look!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Nine meters.  Eight.
"They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?"
"Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters."
Fifteen meters.
Seal the door.
Range twenty meters.
Just get back here!
They cut the power.
"Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way."
Think of what?  We're fucked.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
"Uh, what's next?"
Thanks.
"Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here."
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
"Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening."
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
"Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man."
Looks like it stung him.
"Sounds like you, Hicks."
"Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his."
So what do I tell this guy?
Yeah.  What?
No.. I've slept enough.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Terrible.
And how are we today?
"Yes, honey.  I think we both can."
Can we dream?
That's right.
Are we going to sleep now?
"Right here, baby.  Right here."
Mommy...Mommy?
"Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight."
I knew you'd come.
"Newt, wait!"
"This way.  Come on, we're almost there!"
Sure.  Go left.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Look!
Burke!  Open the door!
"I know, honey.  Me too."
"Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared."
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Wah...?  Where are...?
"Newt.  Newt, wake up."
Don't go!  Please.
You mean dead.
Gone.
Where is she?
Yes.  A little girl.
Did you ever have a baby?
"No, it's different, honey."
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
"I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth."
Did one of those things grow inside her?
"Well, some kids can't handle it like you can."
Why do they tell little kids that?
"Yes, there are, aren't there."
"Oh.  Sorry, Newt."
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
"I'm sorry, Newt."
"I guess we're not leaving, right?"
"You're really something, ace."
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
And hope to die?
Cross my heart.
You promise?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
They're dead.
"They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would."
Why not?
I don't want you for a friend.
What about me?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What did you say?
Sweet Jesus.
"Sixty, maybe seventy families."
How many colonists?
What are you talking about. What people?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
"Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be..."
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
"Look, I told you..."
What do you mean?
His Grace is very angry with you.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Indeed.
"Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?"
Certainly!
"Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word."
Meaning you didn't like it.
Extremely clever.
What did you think of the music?
You were sublime.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
"Well, what does it matter to you?"
The marriage!
What?
Did you know? Had you heard?
"Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste."
"Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina."
Why?
You might be disappointed.
What does he look like?
Perhaps.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
"Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it."
A Turkish brothel.
Oh!
A brothel.
What's that?
In a harem.
Where?
"Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?"
Why not?
How do you know?
No.
Is there a part for me?
Yes.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
"Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart."
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Good morning.
Maestro.
"Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore."
What??
Is she a good fuck?
I'm so relieved.
"No, she's fine."
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Oh - excuse me!
I'll be right back.
Don't bother.
What?
Don't bother!
"Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!"
You have leave to try.
And how will you make him keep it?
"Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat."
Sir -
Hardly.
No! I won't have him back.
"If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me."
Humiliated?
"Why what, sir?"
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
What are you talking about?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Why?
Yes!
Now?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Where?
I want to go!
What is it?
Go back to bed.
It's killing me.
Why not?
I can't write it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
"Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard."
Why?
No. Don't answer it!
You'd think I was mad.
Why not?
I'm not telling you.
I heard voices.
No one.
Who was that?
"Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!"
"Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki."
"Oh, Stanzi."
Why not? Half the house!
You're not going to do this?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Your father is dead.
What?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
"Yes, my love?"
Wolfi.
Stanzi!
"Oh, damn!"
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
"Well, ask her!"
I don't know.
What does she want?
There's a young girl to see you.
"Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here."
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Wolfi!
"May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?"
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
"Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart."
I love you! I love you!
Yes!
No!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tell them to go!
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Don't be stupid.
"Well, don't do that again!"
Yes!
You borrowed money from your mother?
"Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!"
Oh yes? You always know everything.
"No, they will not. I know how things work in this city."
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
"Oh, leave me alone."
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Of course.
"Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?"
Eat my - ah!
Yes.
Eat
Tish-I'm-tee.
What?
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
No!
"No, this is serious. Say it backwards."
"No, I'm not playing this game."
Em iram! Em iram!
"No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!"
"Yes, you are. You're very sick."
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
"Oh, ha, ha, ha."
"Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years."
Do you think that's funny?
Why? People fart backwards.
That's stupid.
Why not?
"Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway."
Fartsbishop!
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Where?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
No! No! No!
Stop it!
"Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here."
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
This is not his handwriting.
And I'm asking you -
He asked me to stay.
"No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please."
"He needs me, ma'am."
"Well, thank you very much. You can go now."
I was at hand.
Why you?
"Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home."
What are you doing here?
What?
But! I'm a married woman!
Isn't it obvious?
What do you mean?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What for?
Alone.
Tonight?
Come back tonight.
"Oh, thank you, sir!"
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
It is miraculous.
"Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies."
These are originals?
Yes.
Originals?
"Thank you very much, Your Excellency."
I see.
"No, sir. This is my own idea."
Then he didn't send you?
Really?
I understand.
"He's terribly busy, sir."
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Frau Mozart?
Madame. How can I help you?
Excellency!
"You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi."
Money! Money!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
He's doing his best.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Leave him alone!
I hope so. I need it immediately.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Where's our friend?
Not at all.
Am I interrupting something?
How much will you pay him?
Do you hear him? Do you?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
"Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!"
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
In three months! Papa.
"When, may I ask?"
"Oh, yes."
I see that you're expecting.
Behold!
Behold!
Hey!
Hey!
Behold!
Behold!
Adorable!
He's adorable!
Be careful!
Be careful!
"Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!"
"I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass."
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
"I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders."
"I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted."
"Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor."
Yes. He is a little strange.
What a strange young man.
Michael!
I said play!
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Gertrude!
Upstairs.
"Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know."
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Who was your teacher?
Just one year.
Wine?
"I'd like a little wine, if you have it."
"Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?"
"Ah, now! Here she comes."
Really?
"Well, look at them."
"Do you like this, Salieri?"
"Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson."
Yes?
Really?
Of course not.
"Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician."
Oh?
Why not?
"I don't think you understand me, Court Composer."
Well. There it is.
Sire.
"You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea."
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes?
"An interesting idea, Majesty. But -"
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
"Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!"
Your Highness.
"Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth."
"Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue."
"Well, I'm glad to hear that."
My pleasure.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
"And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri."
Ah-ha!
"A-flat, Majesty."
"You do me too much honour, Sire."
Majesty.
May I try it?
"It's just a trifle, of course."
What a charming idea. May I see?
"You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade."
"Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives."
"Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!"
I have no idea.
"Ah, love again."
"But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love."
"Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy."
Would you tell me why?
"Well, yes, I admit it is."
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
"Who told you this, Majesty?"
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
"Yes, Sire."
Ah! By all means.
What is it?
"Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?"
"Thank you, Sire!"
"Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man."
Twenty-six.
"Excuse me, but how old are you?"
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
"Enchanted, Madame."
"Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady."
"Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?"
"What do you mean, Sire?"
"So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?"
"Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!"
And German?
"Yes, indeed."
"It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?"
"I think so, Sire, yes."
What? On one hearing only?
Ah-ha.
"In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio."
"Yes, where?"
"Well, what is it about? Tell us the story."
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Why so?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Majesty!
"Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely."
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
"Oh, thank you."
Your Majesty!
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
He's here.
"Yes, what about him?"
"Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -"
"Well, what do you have for me today?"
Well. There it is.
"Yes, sir."
"Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?"
Father -
She does. She says I sleep all day.
No one calls you that.
"Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden."
Papa!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Mine?
"Papa, is this your idea?"
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
"I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son."
"Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!"
"This is just a game, Papa."
"No, really!"
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's a secret.
Why not?
"Oh, let's not talk about it."
What's that?
This one will.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
How many?
Yes.
Yes.
Pupils?
How many pupils do you have?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
They say you're in debt.
That's not what I hear.
It couldn't be better.
How is your financial situation?
Don't you have a maid?
Do you always live like this?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Is she not here?
"Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!"
Am I not welcome?
Why are you here?
I will.
Are you sure it's an opera?
Opera? Opera!
"I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera."
Is he working?
Is he working?
"Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over."
Where?
I don't know. He has pains.
What medicine?
Why? What has happened?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
"In there, sir."
Where does he work?
Yes what?
"I think I've found out about the money, sir."
"Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir."
Really? What is it he's writing?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Not that I've seen.
Do any pupils come to the house?
"Oh, thank you, sir."
Bene.
"Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir."
Bene! Bene!
"Yes, thank you, sir."
"Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?"
"I will, sir."
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
"Good morning, sir."
"Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning."
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
What?
That's right.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Yes?
So let me see it. Where is it?
"Well, we can."
Because there's nothing to see.
Why not?
No.
Can I see it?
Yes.
"What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?"
What?
"Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you."
What is this?
Put it down!
Wolfi!
Leave that alone!
So there you are. What do you say?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
German!
Animals?
I liked the horse.
"Yes, well, it's all good fun."
"Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?"
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Well?
What did he say? What did he say?
Sssh! Stay here.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sssh!
"My answer is no, Mozart."
"Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir."
I'm sorry. No.
"Well, this is hardly the way to go about it."
"If a man cannot earn, he must borrow."
What for?
"What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?"
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
"Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man."
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
"It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!"
"Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning."
"Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg."
"Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?"
I'm afraid I am.
Madame.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
What for?
I am so ashamed.
I'm not leaving you.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
"I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?"
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Do you want to rest a bit?
Yes.
Do you have it?
You go fast!
And that's it. Do you have it?
Yes!
"Yes, and on 'dictis'."
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
That's wonderful!
Show me.
I think so.
Do you have me?
And that's all?
Also identical?
With the tenors.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
It couldn't be simpler.
Please! Just one moment.
"Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis."
Yes.
Sing it back.
I think so.
Yes.
Common time.
What time?
The Fire.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Yes.
We ended in F Major?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Come. Let's begin.
Strange!
"Oh, yes."
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
What?
Do you believe in it?
Consigned to flames of woe.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Where did I stop?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
Of course.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
"My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure."
"Would you? Actually, you could."
"Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?"
He knows. He knows!
Finish what?
What man?
The man. He's here.
Who?
"No! No, it's him!"
Shall I answer it?
I'm too young to be so sick.
What?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Are you ill?
I do.
Do you mean that?
This is only a vaudeville.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
"No, please."
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
You mean she's not coming back?
"Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa."
Where is your wife?
"No, no. I have to get back. I have -"
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
What happened? Is it over?
Are you neglecting my request?
How long will you give me?
How much?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
Who are you?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
What dead? Who is dead?
A Mass for the dead.
What work?
I have come to commission work from you.
You flatter me.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Yes?
"How could it not, Excellency?"
Did my work please you?
How could I not?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
"Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!"
"Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!"
"Oh no, the honour would be all mine."
"I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that."
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
But what is it they don't like?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
"Thank you! Oh, thank you."
"With all my heart, Mozart."
"Oh, Excellency, would you?"
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
How fortunate.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
You burned the score?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Really? Why?
"Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?"
I can't say. Really
What exactly are you working on?
"Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?"
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Ah. Italian?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
"Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?"
"Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly."
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
"Ah, how exciting! Tell me more."
I'm afraid not.
Do you have a daughter?
Of course not.
"No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why."
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
"Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage."
"No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity."
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Herr Sommer.
Whom did they choose?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
"So you see, this post is very important to me right now."
"I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course."
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
"Herr Mozart, what brings you here?"
How could I not?
"Did you like it, then?"
"Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations."
But this is absurd!
"Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty."
"Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that."
"Love, Sire!"
"A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things."
Ah!
Mio caro Adone.
Really?
"Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!"
"Can we see the scene with the music back, please?"
Taking out what you should never have put in.
"What are you doing, Herr Director?"
Exactly. A dance.
"Certainly, Herr Director."
"Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away."
Just let me tell you how it begins.
"That will do, Herr Mozart!"
"But, Your Majesty -"
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Exactly.
You mean in Turkey?
I think you'd better.
Oh? Have I seen it?
"May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?"
Herr Mozart -
"Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!"
Mozart -
Mozart -
"Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!"
"Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri."
Who is on this committee?
A little modesty would suit you better.
"No, but I'm the best."
"Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna."
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
On the contrary.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
What is what?
"What is this, Herr Chamberlain?"
Mozart -
Baron!
"Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine."
"Oh, German! German! Please let it be German."
"I don't think it was really decided, Director."
"Oh my son, my poor son!"
What difference does that make?
But not his body.
I poisoned his life.
"No, you didn't!"
I did.
Yes.
What?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
"My son, no one can speak for God."
No? Was Mozart a good man?
You cannot say that!
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Did you try?
"He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered."
Do you hear me?
Should I?
Do you believe it?
Is it true?
And do they believe it?
All Vienna has heard that.
Ah - you've heard that?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
"Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that."
I regret it is not too familiar.
Well?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Then you must know this.
Here in Vienna.
Where?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
How well are you trained in music?
I do not seek forgiveness.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Are they?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
"Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?"
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Leave me alone.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
What do you want?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
So?
"You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?"
About what?
What do you want?
"Yes, in the third act."
"Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?"
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Ballet? What ballet?
About the ballet.
What anger?
The Emperor has given him permission.
Incredible.
"Well, Mozart is already rehearsing."
Never mind.
Where?
I've seen the manuscript.
Are you absolutely sure?
You must be mad.
Yes.
He's setting that play to music?
Exactly.
You mean that play?
Italian?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Yes?
"I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director."
Ah.
"Oh yes, yes. And that was?"
"For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France."
Did we?
"Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian."
"Well done, Sire!"
"Bravo, Your Majesty!"
"Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you."
"Of course now. Right away, before I get any older."
What do you mean - now?
"Well, promise then."
I can't wait.
"Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck."
"I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish."
What? Who the devil are you?
"Here I am, my angel."
"How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent."
"I agree, Baron."
Come with me. And stay in the room.
What does he want?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
"That lady is back, sir."
"Excuse me, my dear."
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Who is she?
"Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you."
"Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!"
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
I'll call tomorrow.
Bene.
Of course.
"Well, tell him we were here, won't you?"
But he's all right?
"Well, he's sleeping now. Better not."
Can we come in?
"Yes, I am looking after him."
Herr Salieri.
Thank you.
"You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?"
"What do you mean, 'how did he look'?"
How did he look?
"The American? Yes, duck."
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
David?
Tea would be nice.
What shall we do?
I expect you shortly.
"No, a cab will be faster."
Shall I send a car?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
"Yes, Doctor."
"Yes, I should think so."
Could you get here without any trouble?
"No, not really."
Is David acting strangely?
"No, why?"
The zoo? Is he rational?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He's here.
What shall we do?
Dr. Hirsch?
Surely you're not suggesting...
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
And what else?
Yes.
"Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?"
Warn him?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
What did he say?
Yes.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
"Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?"
He's not?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
It's a full moon. Where is he?
"Yes, sir."
"Come to my office, Miss Price."
"It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have."
"Yes, I believe he did."
Did he say a wolf?
"No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor."
What happened to them?
"That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed."
He said 'Jack'.
What exactly did he call out?
"Yes, Doctor?"
"Oh, Miss Price?"
"Yes, Doctor."
Go about your duties.
Dr. Hirsch?
"Can I be of service, Miss Price?"
"Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital."
"Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago."
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
"David, don't lose control."
"David, let's go now."
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Will you shut up!?!!
"Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and..."
"I swear, I don't know this girl."
We had an argument. He's being silly.
What?
"He's playing a stupid joke, sir."
"Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!"
"David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch."
Jack is dead!
"David, stop!"
"Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex."
"David, what are you doing?"
Pull over.
But...
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I should be committed.
The next corner we can get a cab.
Don't you remember?
The zoo?
I'm freezing.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
See you later.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
A doper werewolf.
I've left those pills for you.
Okay.
"Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?"
"Yeah, I do, but go to work."
"David, do you want me to stay here tonight?"
Werewolves simply do not exist.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Anything.
Do me an enormous favor?
"Let me go now, you'll make me late."
"That's good, Alex.  Reassure me."
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I wasn't hallucinating.
"But, David."
I was awake and he was in my room.
Good.
Of course.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Yes?
Alex?
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you.
"David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower."
There is only one bed.
The bedroom.
Lovely.
Bathroom.
Charming.
Closet.
Very nice.
The kitchen.
"Yeah, I would think so, too."
I would think so.
I was dreaming again?
Your dead friend Jack?
My friend Jack was just here.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Are you better now?
A werewolf?
I'm a werewolf.
Now I'm embarrassed.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
"You're being awfully forward, aren't you?"
Not just a patient -- me.
Will you think about it?
What?
Will you come with me?
That's easy enough.
"No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while."
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Hello. You all right?
"Yes, go on."
"What? Oh, yes, please."
Shall I read to you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Now what do you want to talk about?
I know.
I'm twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I dream of death mostly.
What do you dream about?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Do you like it?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I was. What are you reading?
I thought you were asleep.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Will you give me a break?
"Let's try a little harder, shall we?"
Right.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
"Shall I be forced to feed you, David?"
Call me David.
"Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?"
"Aw come on, Alex!"
Call me Alex.
"Aw come on, Miss Price!"
Sorry.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
How is that?
"You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler."
"Please, really. I'm not hungry."
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
"I'm not very hungry, thank you."
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Yes?
Mr. Kessler?
A wolf.
What?
It was a wolf.
I beg your pardon?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I thought not.
No.
"Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?"
No!
No what?
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
Right.
No.
No.
Feeling better?
No.
"Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this."
No.
No what?
No.
"Hello, Benjamin."
I looked.
Why on earth do you say that?
I think he's a Jew.
Chart says he's from New York.
"Yes, I should think. He called out just now."
He all right?
"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
Has he been refusing food?
"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
Miss Price.
"That's what I want you to do, you moron!"
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Who is this girl?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Now see here young man.
There's no call for that kind of language.
"Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!"
"All right, you two, move along."
"You did, did you?"
"Officer, I killed those people last night."
Why are you doing this to me?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
"Why are you doing this to me, Jack?"
You could have told them!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
"That's very funny, that is."
No. You've had your chance.
"Oh, come on, tell us."
"All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it."
"Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!"
"You be quiet, woman, and let me speak."
"No, but we're about to."
"Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?"
Bambi?
"Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?"
"Some, everyone does."
"Do you have bad dreams, too?"
What are you going to see?
"Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you."
Alex?
What time is it?
I was having a nightmare.
"Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please."
"Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price."
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
"You really think I'm crazy, don't you?"
I really don't know.
"No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here."
Did you see Jack?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Yes.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
"Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre."
You've never had bad dreams before?
"Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about."
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
So they said.
There were witnesses?
Lunatic?
Two weeks?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
How long have I been here?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
"Miss Price! Miss Price, please!"
"Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead."
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You're in a hospital in London.
Where am I?
"If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death."
I could hang myself.
How shall I do it?
Because this must be stopped.
Hello.
"David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly."
I want you to meet some people.
What about the zoo?
Thank you.
You look awful.
"If I was still alive, I probably would."
"Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?"
You don't have to say anything.
"What can I say, Jack?"
"Hi, David."
"Hi, Jack."
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You must believe me.
What do you think?
"Jack, are you really dead?"
"You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late."
"A monster. I know, I know."
"David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become..."
"Get out of here, Jack!"
Yes.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
"Okay, you've seen me. Now go away."
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing here?
"Don't be an asshole, David. Come here."
You're not real.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Nurse!
"Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance."
Nurse!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
"Jack, please go away. Please go away."
"Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days."
"Stop it, Jack."
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What?!
"It's you, David."
Will you be quiet?!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
"Shut up, you zombie!"
"On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf."
I'm not listening!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
"Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?"
What?!
David!
I'm going completely crazy.
Life mocks me even in death.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I can't stand it.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
"I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come."
David! You're hurting my feelings.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Thanks a lot.
"Get the fuck out of here, Jack."
Nice to see you.
Are you going to help me up?
"You really scared me, you shithead."
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'll tell you when we get there.
Where are we going?
Yeah.
Jack?
Not far enough. Come on.
It sounds far away.
No.
See anything?
"Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away."
"Walk away, Jack."
Nice doggie. Good boy.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Oh shit. What is that?
Do you think it's a dog?
It's in front of us.
Let's just keep walking.
Plan?
What's the plan?
It's circling us.
It's moving.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
"Come on, where?"
I don't know. Come on.
"Shit! David, what is that?"
Yeah.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
"It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'."
"No, but he was on the moors."
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Heathcliffe.
Pecos Bill.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
A coyote.
Yeah?
Could be a lot of things.
What was it?
I heard that.
Did you hear that?
"Say, David..."
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I have no idea.
What do you think was wrong?
"Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob."
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
"Come on, I'm freezing."
Beware the moon?
What the hell was that all about?
Apparently so.
"Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!"
What do you mean? I'm starving.
"Jack, we'd better go."
You ask them.
"Go on, ask them."
Wrong.
Right.
You ask them.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
It's a five-pointed star.
What about it?
Look at that.
"Listen, at least it's warm in here."
Nice looking group.
Nice to see you.
Hello.
Shall we?
Okay.
I assume full responsibility.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
That's a wolf's head.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
"If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you."
I don't know.
"Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?"
You're talking about the woman I love.
She's a jerk.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Right.
"I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later."
"Well, I like it here."
"Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?"
You're not having a good time are you?
David.
Jack.
Good.
Yes.
Are you cold?
"Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you."
What can we do to assist you?
Why don't we ask him?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
You were saying?
"Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?"
"No, thank you, Doctor."
"Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?"
Dr. Hirsch?
He's on the telephone.
What here?
"Roger Mathison, Doctor."
Excuse me.  Yes?
Send them in.
"Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor."
Yes?
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
What's that?
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
"Sorry, love."
Campari and soda would do nicely.
"Hello, there. What can I get you?"
I beg your pardon?
Remember the Alamo?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Oh.
No.
Then you have some hot tea?
Hot chocolate?
No.
Do you have any hot soup?
"We'll find him, not to worry."
"I don't rightly know, sir."
"And what, Sergeant?"
"Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and..."
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sorry.
"I'd like some tea, please."
"No, thank you."
Yeah - sure!
Yes - sureó
"If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?"
Why not?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
"But listen, Tom, Ió"
I want to know why .
"Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?"
"What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!"
You here again? What do you want?
"Hello, Tom."
Yeah.
He has?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Matt?
Where's Matt?
No kidding?
"Oscar, what's the matter?"
"Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own."
Yeah.
I remember once when your account checked.
"What's the matter, Charlie?"
Where you been?
"Aw, nerts!"
"Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?"
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Whose death?
"Baby, I can't give you anything but love..."
Yeah?
Charlie!
"Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit."
Let me have ten bucks?
Yeah.
"Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?"
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
It was more than that last week.
About twenty-four thousand.
How much?
"Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls."
"Yes, sir."
And tell him not to delay.
"Yes, sir."
"Not yet, Mr. Clark."
Mr. Dickson in yet?
"Take it easy, Clark."
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What good will that do?
"Don't make me laugh, Schultz!"
"Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right."
We've been waiting fifteen minutesó
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
"Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank."
"Say, you can't do tható"
"Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob."
"That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?"
"What do you mean, help?"
We'll discuss that in the board room.
What about?
We want to talk to you.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
"Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?"
Just pure luck!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
"Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!"
"All right, Jack, all right."
"Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun."
"Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""
Thanks.
"Why, of course."
You understand?
Oh!
"Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady."
"That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary."
That's very simple. I was home.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
"Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?"
"I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett."
"Get out, get out!"
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
"But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!"
Fifty thousand dollars!
"I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson."
"Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?"
"Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!"
"But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?"
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
"know, butó"
What do you mean?
You don't have to do nothing.
"Why, I couldn't do that . . . !"
Why not?
"Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that Ió"
We can take blood from anything ó  If it's comin' to us.
"But after all, you can't take blood from a stone."
That don't do us any good.
"I'm sorry, Dude, butóIó"
I haven't got it.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
"You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?"
What are you doing here?
"Why, Matt!"
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
"And now fair woman, I have you in my power."
A misunderstood bachelor.
"What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]"
Good for you. Come on.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
My apartment.
What's this?
Cyril!
"Why, Cyril, you're insaneó"
"Now wait a minute, wait a minute..."
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What?
I want to be near you!
No.
Don't you know?
Why are you so anxious?
"Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway."
"Well, aren't you going to invite me?"
"Well, what?"
Welló
"Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!"
"See, we're getting along famously!"
"Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?"
Doesn't that come next?
"But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned."
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Line?
"If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would."
"órunning around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!"
What is?
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
"Well, you can. You always could."
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Me?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
"Why, I needed aó"
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
"I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion."
I'm not interested in what you think.
"Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning."
I'm listening.
"Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you."
"Oh, yeah?"
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
"Yes, now."
Now?
"Let me see your cash book, will you?"
"Yes, sir."
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
"Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too."
"Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning."
"Of course, let them in! You're late now."
Shall we let the people come in?
Thank you!
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Excuse meó
Got a handkerchief?
"Much better this morning, thank you."
"John, how's your wife this morning?"
"Good morning, Mr. Dickson."
"Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . ."
No.
Happy now?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
Well . . .
"Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . ."
Ho! Ho! Ho!
"Yes, of course."
"That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?"
The theatre?
"But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting."
"I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear."
Yes.
"Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?"
"Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight."
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
"Hello, darling."
"Well, look who's here! Hello, dear."
Oh!
"Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!"
Good morning.
"Good morning, Helen."
"Numbers? No, never mind."
"You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?"
"Yes, sir."
Now don't you worry about it.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Where is he now?
"Yes, sir."
"Helen, tell Matt I want to see him."
"I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either."
Longer.
"Directors, eh? Long faces?"
"Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room."
"Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?"
"Why - well, Ió"
I don't know.
Good morning.
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Yes?
Helen!
All right. Send him in.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
"Yes, sir."
Yes?
Mr. Dickson?
"Hello, Helen."
"Yes, thank you."
Got my letter?
"Good morning, Mr. Dickson."
"Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke."
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
"Yes, sir."
"Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, make that uniform blue."
"Why, I don't know."
"My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?"
"No, sir."
You haven't got a uniform?
I haven't any.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
"Gee, thanks, Mr. Dicksonó"
But I haven't . . .
"All right. That's all.  Please, Matt."
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
"You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?"
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
"No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!"
You're protecting somebody.
No. I won't.
I can't tell you.
There you are.
I already told him I was home.
"I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?"
"Well, Ió"
"Sure, I think it's swell."
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
It's all right. Thanks.
You're lying!
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
"Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years."
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
"Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record."
"If he can do it, yes."
"All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?"
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
What time did this thing happen?
Yes.
Why pick on him ?
"I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson."
"Yes, sir."
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Don't you think I know it?
What'll we do?
"Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place."
Mine too?
"Yes, sir."
Did you get the case for the securities?
"Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy."
"Yes, sir."
What are you talking about?
The lobby's half filled now.
"Yes, sir."
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
"Well, Sampson, what is it?"
"Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right."
"It's his life insurance money, you know."
Absolutely.
Is it safe?
"Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here."
All right.
Hardly.
No.
"Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?"
I'm afraid so.
"Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose."
He's at a board meeting.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
"How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson."
"Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!"
Mr. Williams . . .
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
"Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone."
Did you talk to him?
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
They must have turned him down.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
"What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?"
"Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right."
"Oh, Matt . . ."
"All right, dear."
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
"Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in."
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
"Oh now, don't be silly."
"Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?"
"Oh, Charlie again."
What's keeping you?
In Cluett's office?
"I tell you, I saw them!"
"Oh Matt, you must be mistaken."
"Well, he was making love to her."
Well . . . ?
"What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death."
Yeah.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
"Yeah, swell."
"Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?"
"Oh, Matt."
"All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar."
Yes.
"Oh, you think I'm lying?"
No.
Yes.
"Oh, ten dollarsó"
The ten dollars.
With what?
What did you do with it?
"Oh, is that so?"
"Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!"
"Come here, honey!"
Why?
"Matt, come here!"
"Hello, Helen!"
"Yes, sir."
Are you sure?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He was here?
He was in the bank yesterday.
"Yes, why?"
Did you say Dude Finlay?
"Yes, sir."
Dude Finlay?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
"What did you find out, Mike?"
"That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks."
There you are!
"Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet."
No. It wasn't earlier because...
It couldn't have been earlier?
"Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause..."
Was it twelve o'clock?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Huh?
What time was it?
"What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?"
"ófor the rheumatism, you know."
"Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?"
Then where were you?
"But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . ."
Yes.
"Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?"
"Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock."
What time did you get in?
Yes.
So you were home last night?
I don't know.
Then who changed it?
"You used to carry a gun, didn't you?"
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
wasn't anywhere near this placeó
"Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!"
Where's Charlie?
I guess so.
Everybody in?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
"Yeah, what did he do with his first one?"
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
You've got enough?
"I'm okay, Matt."
How are you fixed?
"Okay, Matt."
Now you tell us.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
This is healing?
"Jim Younger, I told you--"
I couldn't lose him.
"Tom, I'm this close to coming with you..."
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
"I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche."
You can ride like that?
It's tougher than it looks.
He's not bad at it.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
"I'm sorry, Cole."
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I swear --
Swear.
Bob. I didn't...
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
I ain't done --
What have you done?
How'd they --
"Leave me alone, Bob."
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
This is the best score yet.
What?
"Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out."
"We got a problem here, brother?"
How?
"No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing."
"You stay out of this, Bob."
"Uhh, yeah it does."
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
"Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite."
"Zee, I'm pleased you came."
"Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin."
That was two hours ago.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Never a good thing.
He's smiling.
"Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!"
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Tomorrow.
The Army can hang him.
Damn!
He just lost his temper a little.
Oh no...
... Will Perry ...
"Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ..."
Then I love it.
Nope.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
"Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!"
Yesterday.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Tell me.
"Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble..."
What?
He's planning a job.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
"Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole."
You are a fine figure of a man.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."
"You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!"
Beg pardon?
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
"Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go..."
"""Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."""
Hey!
"All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours."
Exactly.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
You have no shame.
Two.
How many of them did he kill?
Best damn plan I heard all war.
"You shut up now, boy."
How?
I think I recognize you.
What you sayin' boy?
"You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!"
What?
Where'd you get all these riders?
"Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind."
"You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --"
"Missed you too, cousin."
"Missed you, cousin."
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
I'm out.
We'll make them pay for this.
Pass me some whisky.
"Bob, rip up some bandages."
"Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!"
"Okay, you're gonna rest here."
A trap.
Dammit!
Fine. We hit this bank.
"Then let me run the show, General Lee."
Still smells fishy.
And I'm the better outlaw.
"I'm the better soldier, Jesse."
That's it.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I got us through the War all right.
A bad idea.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Beautiful.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
What are you saying?
"If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems."
"Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper."
What will be?
It'll be the biggest score yet.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Yep.
"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
"Sure, cousin."
"Jesse, we got to have a word."
Twenty?!
It's not a bank.
"See, Frank's being smart about this."
I got three.
I got seven thousand.
Don't let it happen again.
Sorry.
The James-Younger Gang.
Let's ride.
"Perfect, Cole."
"So what do we do, General Lee?"
Yeah.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
It was exciting.
"The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it."
"After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?"
Thanks for the help.
"All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --"
She was European!
She had a moustache.
She got two of them.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
What is wrong with you?
Not now.
"Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that."
"You're not scared, are you?"
"Hands off your hip, Cole."
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
"Home, boys. Back to our farms."
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Where you boys going?
I could use the walk.
"Ride with me, cousin?"
What's going on?
"'Bout time you got here, buddy."
I'm thinking...
Well?
You ride like a Comanche.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
"Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom."
They're just insurance in case we run.
They gonna rush us?
Another dozen out back.
"Cole, he didn't mean that."
Jesse.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Strategically.
Get buckets!
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Ah.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
"I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice."
Sadie was not a man!
"Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's..."
The brown one.
"Which one, right or left?"
I think one of 'em's glass.
"Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys."
What the --
"Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up."
Both would be nice.
Cannon or Gatling?
"All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk..."
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
This here is the Younger Gang!
Where is Jesse James?
What?
"Of course!  Uh, sir?"
The safe. Now.
Me get heap firewater --
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Ho-yah!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Of St. Louis?
The District Marshall
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
"Yeah, Injun. What do you want?"
You 'um big lawman?
I'd appreciate that.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
It's a secret.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
On account of we're robbing it.
Then why can't I go in there?
"You're right, sir."
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Shit.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Where the hell were you?
So?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What is it?
What the --
"It's fine by me, Jesse."
You know you're welcome any time!
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
"What do you say, sir?"
"Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys."
Boys...
Died a hero.
Web died fighting?
My little Web did that?
"-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee."
He thinks this is some kind of game!
I think he's already feeling better.
"Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning."
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
They're gone. What are you --
"He's going to be fine, right Daddy?"
"Daddy, don't start with this again."
"Hell, they hardly even noticed us."
"See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there."
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Jim was old enough...
"Got any ideas, little brother?"
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
"No, I --"
"You taking sides against me, now, Frank?"
Oh yeah.
We're drunk.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
We're doing this for Ma.
If I could go back to farming --
You've killed your fair share of men.
And we're good at it.
"Jesse, we're outlaws."
This has been a good year.
The posters?
Bob's upset.
"Gents, we are in the middle of something here."
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
We're gonna have to talk...
Fine. How'd it go out here?
How'd it go in there?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Don't care.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Ma.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
What do you think?
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Heard of him.
You know him?
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
She's still talking to Jesus.
"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
You are a charmer.
You can shut up now.
"""Big and older""?"
"Maybe, maybe..."
That just might work.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
"Zee, we got to talk to you and your father."
You're doing just fine.
"Frank, don't you have something to say?"
"We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here."
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
"Hello, Liberty Missoura!"
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hell of a war.
I reckoned.
Web's dead.
I figure.
That would have made an impression.
"You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats."
Such as?
Mm-hmm.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Distracting enough for you?
So we got a plan?
Everything but the boring parts.
How much of that story is true?
Yeah Jimmy?
Uncle Frank?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
So what was he?
Can't argue that.
"But he killed a lot of men, too."
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
They're making him a hero now.
That he was.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
"Yeah, Jimmy?"
"Y'know, Uncle Frank..."
Shush.
Doc Mimms will --
"Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers."
"We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms."
Riders --
Boys?
Ma! Please!
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
"We're just fine, thank you, sir."
Easterners.
"Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend."
Say your prayers?
"A fair number, Ma."
Did you kill Yankees?
I'll explain on the way.
Tennessee?
Yes ma'am.
Don't swear.
You are a hell of a woman.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Yes ma'am.
"You get arrested again, I'll kill you."
"If you don't see it, it's not real..."
What?
Don't turn around.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
Stop it. This is just sad.
"Aw, shucks, ma'am..."
Let me see that.
I beg your pardon?
"""Hmm"" what?"
Hmm.
"Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?"
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I don't understand.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Zee.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Let the law --
Me neither.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
"I am so sorry, Jesse."
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Yep.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Little ones.
Sparkling rocks?
"Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth."
Where will you find such a girl?
And what's this right girl like?
Not if I find the right girl.
"You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?"
"Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor."
"Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy."
A river pirate.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
You didn't want to farm?
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
What?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
"What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean."
Teasing you is completely unfair.
"No! I mean, of course not. No."
You're sick of my company?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You shouldn't be up.
Nuh-huh ...
"Jesse, is that your hand?"
Mmmm.
"Jesse, are you awake?"
But still died.
But you got big!
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Fair enough.
Thanks.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
"No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit."
"Ahh, you'll miss me."
You cocky little bastard.
I'm not hanged yet.
That's what I would have done.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Was it worth it?
I figured.
"Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know."
"No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one."
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
"Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me."
Damn.
Yes?
Mmm.
Last February?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Pity.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Did you order our houses burned down?
That's the idea.
But I like the presidential suite.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Communion.
Right here in church?
Now let's have a drink.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Thank you.
"Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth."
"You don't think God'll mind, do you?"
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
"You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy."
"Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time..."
This time we'll make an exception.
... too young for whisky...
What about that Rock Island bastard?
You do that.
I swear.
I think so.
You been with a girl ever?
"Well, not exactly."
"Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm."
"Jim, you been with a girl yet?"
I guess so.
"Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink."
"Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky."
"You okay, Jesse?"
No.
I like that.
And the same age Web was. No.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And you're too young.
"Don't talk about it much, though."
Really?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
"Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?"
Lyla Devereux.
"Thank you, Miss -- ?"
I just though you were awful cute.
Not at all.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Really?
"Yes, but just so I could find out who you were."
"Oh, you were talking to Jesse."
"I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name."
"Why, yeah."
Move you fools!
There's only four of them...
How can that be?
By burning down their homes?
They had to be dealt with!
I'm doing you folks a favor --
"Well, this land is about to be condemned."
"Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?"
How did you know?
I remember you.
This is him.
"Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain."
That.
"What, sir?"
What is that?
Sir?
Parker.
I look forward to seeing it.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
"We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!"
With my money!
"What is going on here, man?"
Your men knew the risks.
We did.
THEN WHO DID?!
"To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks."
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
How much did they get from the safe?
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Just perfect.
Yes sir.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Good.
"I can completely understand your distress, sir."
Really!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Vengeance.
What the hell is that sound?
"Why, their intense hatred of you, of course."
What is that?
Can you put men at all four?
"In English, Pinkerton."
No.
So he's won.
It's going to be a long spring.
Can't you tell me anything?
I demand action.
"Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side."
I can't believe this.
It's going to be a long winter.
So you can't tell me anything?
"Oh, that's the best part."
It is a nice piece of writing.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
This is no game.
I want them arrested and hanged!
You wouldn't have done that?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Nothing.
Yes?
Patrick?
"Yes, Courtney?"
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You never noticed.
I never knew you smoked.
You and...Luis?
That's nice.
"Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe."
What are you doing tonight?
Maybe.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
"Oh God, just get it over with."
"See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?"
Why?
Take it off.
"It's a plain end, see? So?"
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Turn the light on.
It's a plain end. I think.
"What do you want, Courtney?"
"Pull out, goddamnit!"
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out.
Is it a what?
"Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him."
Luis is a despicable twit.
"Mmmm...thanks, Patrick."
"Yes, dear."
This is Dorsia?
Yes.
Are we here?
J&B. Straight.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
"Oh God, Patrick. Shut up."
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Pick me up?
Eight?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
"You like it there, don't you?"
Nice?
Dorsia's nice.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
I can't.
Courtney? Dinner?
"Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go."
"Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed."
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Yes?
Pumpkin?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
On a lot of lithium?
Stop it. I'm...
"What? Oh, I'm...busy."
"Listen, what are you doing tonight?"
It's not that nice.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
"Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here."
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Really?
"Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time."
"So, you're looking great, how have you been?"
Alright.
"Nothing like last time, promise."
I don't think so.
"Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise."
Do you take American Express?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Would you like to see my apartment?
You just haven't been looking.
I haven't seen you around here.
I have to return some videotapes.
But where?
I'm just leaving.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
"Oh God, I can't believe this."
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
"No, no, no."
You're inhuman.
We never really shared one.
But what about the past? Our past?
"Yes, I am."
"You're really serious, aren't you?"
"It's over, Evelyn. It's all over"
"Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?"
We need to talk.
Why? What's wrong?
"I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch."
I want a firm commitment.
It's not.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Are you using minoxidil?
Everybody has a great body now.
He has a great body
"Everybody's good-looking, Patrick."
He's good-looking.
Everybody's rich.
He's rich.
"Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?"
Why don t you just go for Price?
Hi. Pat Bateman.
"Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist."
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
I don't want to talk about it.
"Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly."
No-I can't take the time off work.
We should do it.
Is your Evian spiked?
"Yes, darling?"
Evelyn?
Get married. Have a wedding.
Do...what.
"Listen, what about dinner?"
"No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy."
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
"Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality."
"Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman."
How did you guess?
Because he dated her.
I know her. I knew her.
"But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?"
Nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Good coloring.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
I won't...don't worry.
Don't come back.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
I think you should go now.
There was no ad in the Times.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Are you sure?
"No, he doesn't."
Doesn't he live here?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Can I help you?
No.
Are you my two o'clock?
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
"No, you...didn't?"
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
"Why not, you stupid bastard?"
It's just not.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must..."
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Carnes? Wait.
"But wait, Harold, what do you mean?"
"By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?"
The message you left.
What exactly do you mean?
"It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?"
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
"Yes, naturally."
"Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?"
"Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously."
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Patrick?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Where are you going?
What...is...it?
"Jesus lives, Luis."
"Call me please, Patrick."
Commes des Garcon.
"No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken."
Patrick? Is that you?
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
It looks so soft.
Uh huh.
"That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?"
"Lucky, I guess."
"And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?"
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
"No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing."
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
"Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving."
"Don't, I'll drink it."
This.
Leaving what?
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Ask me a question.
"Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel."
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
"Raised lettering, pale nimbus white..."
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
New card. What do you think?
"What's that, a gram?"
Like what?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
SHUT UP!
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
What?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Maybe it's just the light.
"Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?"
"Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it."
"I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus."
That's Paul Owen.
"It looks that way, doesn't it?"
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
See you then.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
I said we are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
We are totally booked.
"Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?"
"Dorsia, yes?"
"Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam."
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia.
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
"What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?"
Just...say...no!
Why?
...to the office this afternoon.
"I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean."
"Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?"
What are I doing?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
"Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?"
Jean-I'm not-
Where are you?
"Hello? Jean, I need help!"
Patrick? Is that you?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Hmmmm.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Jean? What?
Sorry.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
"Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?"
What's that?
Forget it.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
"Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?"
"Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?"
Interesting.
"No, not really."
Do you have a boyfriend?
"And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?"
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Want a bite?
"Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some."
Jean? Sorbet?
They know me.
You didn't give them a name.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Dorsia is...fine.
"Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want."
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
"Oh, I can't.  I don't know."
"No, come on. Anywhere you want."
"Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision."
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Anywhere you want?
"Well, isn't this a coincidence."
Oh no. I have no plans.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
"Yes, Patrick?"
Jean?
"Yes, Patrick?"
Can you bring Mr...
Patrick?
"Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty."
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Who?
"Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you."
"Ye-es, Je-an?"
Patrick?
What is it?
"Thanks, Patrick."
"Come on, you're prettier than that."
"You don't like this, I take it?"
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Yes?
You look nice today.
"No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?"
I'll do it.
"No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks."
"Oh, something. . romantic?"
"Yes, sir."
Just say no?
Just...say...no.
Oh? And what should I say?
Negative. Cancel it.
After six.
When?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Late?
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
No. I really don't.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
What?
"You think I'm dumb, don't you?"
That's...that's too bad.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
"Welt...it depends, why?"
"I m into, well, murders and executions mostly."
Well...
"No. Flattering, but no."
A model? An actor?
What do you think I do?
"So, what do you do?"
Okay. Do.
Yeah.
Next Saturday?
"Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?"
"Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time."
"Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?"
"Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?"
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Well.
Hello
"Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you."
"Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird."
"Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing."
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Does he do this all the time?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
"Patrick, you re a lunatic."
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
No.
Paul Owen.
Who?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Why would I?
Don't tell him you're here.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
"Elizabeth, it's three in the morning."
She's from...France.
Uh huh?
She's my...cousin.
"What do you mean, she was a hot number."
So who was he with?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Where was Marcus?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
I checked it out. It's clean.
He does? You're sure?
Yes.
"Well, does Marcus have an alibi?"
Yes.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Marcus?
I've questioned him.
And?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
"So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?"
"Suit yourself, I guess."
"Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them."
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
"Not in the mood, I guess."
No hash browns?
I'll be there.
"Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations."
"No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me."
"Not a big music fan, eh?"
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
"Great, yes, I'd like that."
"Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered."
"Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman."
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
"Well, I could he wrong."
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
That's not the information I've received.
What?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Not really.
"Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?"
I mean they want to get caught.
"Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump."
"0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?"
"How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for ""formal questioning?"""
"Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know."
So...you hang out here a lot?
Don.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
"Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman."
"Absolutely, I'm 100% with you."
"Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all..."
Oh really? I didn't know that.
"Uh, no. There's one...down here."
Eerie. Really eerie.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
People just...disappear.
Nothing.
"That's so typical, isn't it?"
"I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?"
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No.
Have you consulted a psychic?
"Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing."
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
What?
Oh.
Hmmm.
"Actually, yes."
But...has anyone seen him in London?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
"Well, maybe he did, huh?"
"Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London."
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
So was I.
We were both seven in 1969.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Don't you know this?
And where did he go to school?
"No, he just hung out there."
He had a yacht?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Hang...out?
Where did Paul hang out?
No. Not really.
Do you feel that way?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Yeah...Yale thing.
Yale thing?
"I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know."
How well did you know him?
Well...
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
No problem.
You sure?
"No, I guess it's okay."
Would you rather I not smoke?
I know. I'm sorry.
Bad habit.
You seem...nervous.
Who do you ask?
"Pardon me, but are you okay?"
Thanks.
Nice. Very nice.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Your address?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Where did you go to school?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
How old are you?
Shoot.
"Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?"
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
"No, really. I'm okay."
Understandable.  Lime?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
"Well, what's the topic of discussion?"
It's no problem
"Oh no, I'm okay."
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
KIMBALL.
"No, I'm okay."
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No. I'm okay.
Coffee?
"Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes."
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
"You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?"
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
"So, what's the topic of discussion?"
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
"No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?"
I can't...I can't find a shelter
"Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God."
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
"Listen, what's your name?"
What am I gonna do?
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm not...
"Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?"
I'm so hungry.
"Gee, uh, that's too bad."
I lost my job...
I'm so hungry.
"It's cold out, too, isn't it?"
I'm so hungry.
"Yes, it is."
Is that a raincoat?
"No, Owen."
"Yes, Owen?"
"Hey, Halberstam?"
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
"No, man. I'm gonna bail."
"Another Martini, Paul?"
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
"Cecelia is, well...you know"
"And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?"
"I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you."
"So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?"
Nobody goes there anymore.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
"Yeah, well, you're late."
"Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here."
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
"Oh well, you know."
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
It's...it's...all right.
"How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?"
I've been great. And you?
"Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?"
"Some guys are just born cool, I guess."
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
"Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen."
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You think so?
I can paint anywhere.
"You don't wanna move, do you?"
I'm just screwed.
You know what I mean.
"""Make"" him?"
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
'Gonna wait outside.
You are a fanatic.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Is it over?
You're just afraid to eat it.
Right. Wait. A toast.
It's gonna get cold.
...wanna savor this.
Great.
Here we go.
"Oh, right. Hold on."
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Milo?
...What?
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
You look beautiful.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Great!
Just shut up?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
"Milo, you --"
Milo --
"He has thousands of employees, Milo --"
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
What?
Look at this.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
...Different?
That was -- different.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
"If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened."
Guilt?
I remember.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Remember Lyle Barton?
...Why?
Nothing?
Nothing.
"It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?"
So you believe me?
...Whaddo I do?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
"You can't just walk in, either."
I can't just walk away!
Milo. Why would he --
You think I don't know that?
"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
They hack into people's programs?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
It was a hate crime.
What're you -- what?
Teddy was killed last night.
What!
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Isn't that -- extreme?
"I know, I know."
He's your boss. He's not your --
"What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?"
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
Milo! What about --?
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
We're not gonna let it.
That took some fun out of --
When's Brian coming for the TV?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
Didn't you visit the campus?
...But?
"I think that's great, Milo. I do."
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
"If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway."
It's important.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
I don't think he knows how.
He wasn't acting?
Prick.
"That'll be a test, won't it?"
He'll tell me when he gets home.
No.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
Yes sir.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
My goodness.
"My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley."
Milo?
"I am. I am, sir."
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Have a seat.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Milo?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
"...It's -- Milo, isn't it?"
"Mr. Barton, do you remember me?"
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Right... What's that mean again?
"Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant."
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
...When did you know?
"He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?"
What?!
Is it your dish?
Is it your software?
Gimme the coordinates?
You're interfaced with our dish.
Wanna be a part of history?
What?!
Okay.
What'd they ever do for you?
What?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
"You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show."
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
"Sure, I'll see what I can do."
You're living here?
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
We tried!
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Outpost doesn't own em.
"That's gotta kill him, right?"
"I think they call him the ""Houseman."" 'Cause ""guard"" sounds too weird."
Who's that?
We could move 'em up here.
He's pretty tight with his family.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Oh hi.
Milo? I'm Danny.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
"Gary, I --"
"Oh, that's right. You're ""clueless."""
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
You could've handwritten it.
'Sorry about the late notice...
That's great! Thanks.
...Worse?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Sure.
'Have a look?
I'm okay. It's going well!
You look a little tired.
"Gary, hi."
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
The wrong place?
"34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way."
"Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there..."
You've been coming in early.
Oh. Yeah.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Talk about work? Never!
Did you?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Were the flags for Teddy?
I heard what happened.
Definitely.
"It scales, don't you think?"
I'm sure.
Nothing!
What're you implying.
You really wrote this just today?
Right... Right.
Well -- you sent for me.
Milo. What's up?
You're making me young again.
You did this -- overnight?
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
It's okay. Really.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
How's it going?
That's what I told her. My wife.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
...Do I?
'Think I should buy some originals?
Okay. I'm Gary.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
I do!
"It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?"
Skywire.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
"There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it."
"You know a lot about art, I guess."
Oh. No thanks.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Cool!
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
...Hello?
Just do it.
Gary?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
What?
Wait... He knows.
Longitude 109 --
Let's go.
Ready for number three?
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
"Okay, #2."
Just do what I'm asking!
"Gary, don't worry, we --"
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
"Hasn't affected his work, though."
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
What'd the girl say?
Maybe we should all get on it.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
This is good. Who did it?
Cool.
"You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?"
Got out of my other commitment.
...You wanna work -- here?
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
"Those really weird, short lines."
"Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style."
Just thought his work should go on.
"I mean, it's your life."
You do?
I think you should go.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Where we going?
Come with me.
I'm calling Gary.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Let's get him in here.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
What're we looking for?
Keep looking.
Every entry was authorized.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Latitude 47 degrees.
What?
...He knows.
Let's try #2.
Maybe it's the satellite.
But you said the other --
Bring it to the other location.
"It's three years old, it --"
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Meet me at the other location.
Please don't go.
Why?!
Does he know you know?
You'll come up with something.
"That's lame, isn't it?"
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Oh.
"Yeah, that's old, in a tree."
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Thank God.
"The dishes are juiced up, too."
Gary.
"""A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"""
What'd he say?
I told Teddy about you.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Why were you snooping in my office?
Why were you so careless?
I don't know --
You mean -- break in?
"Before they kill somebody else, too."
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
"But they'd still get the idea, right?"
A what?
What?
How close are you?
Time?
"But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --"
"What about ""60 Minutes."""
Certainly not at my happy home.
"The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine."
Do we post it on the Net?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Who can we trust?
What about the FBI?
"No, no. Never."
Hmm?
...Milo?
He's out of prison?
They'd frame him.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Oh yeah?
But why would they --?
The Day Care?
Why would you do a thing like --
I snuck into #21.
She saved my life.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Then and now.  But not right now.
Long story. Not that interesting.
Why's that?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You're compulsive.
"Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway."
"Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?"
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
No. Please.
Did you wanna be alone?
Cool!
Show me.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
What've you got there?
Did I say something?
...Something like that. Yeah.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
...Were you?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
You're famous around here.
You know mine.
You know my name.
Lisa.
I didn't plan this.
"Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one."
What does that mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What d'you mean?
Did you tell Alice?
I don't know.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I met this girl.
"Jesus, Teddy."
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
What?!
"But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week."
"Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!"
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
Uh. Not exactly.
Is that how Larry feels?
...You got my E-mail?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
What're they building?
"I've got a girlfriend, remember?"
"Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her."
She's a programmer?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
So how'd you like the house?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
"Yeah, yeah."
Speaking of which...
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
"We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale."
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
"Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now."
We're too late. Take a look.
Where is he?
Who're these guys?
You're not listening.
I could get it out of him.
That kid's the great white hope.
"There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual."
What is it?
"Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man."
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Yes.
Is it about my teeth?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Kiss me.
To my health.
"Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health."
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
"How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?"
Sak-i it to me!
Care for some saki?
Or sometimes not at all.
"In Japan, men come first and women come second."
Groovy.
May I wash you?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Come in.
Behave!
"I didn't, baby, you just told me."
"Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills."
You may.
"Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?"
"What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?"
"What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?"
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You seem surprised to see me.
Smashing!
"Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup."
Hungry.
"Hey, how are you?"
"Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol."
Be careful!
Yes Basil?
"But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--"
"Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all."
"Austin, I have something for you as well."
"Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!"
"Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you."
"I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition."
Thanks.
Be careful.
"Yes, Basil?"
"I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?"
"All right, Austin, I think you should go."
"Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!"
"I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man."
"That's not your mother, that's a man!"
"My God, Austin, what have you done?"
"Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development."
"Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage."
What?
Carnies.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Excuse me?
What's the other?
"Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war."
"Hello, Exposition."
Thank you.
Be careful.
Yes?
"There's one more thing, Austin."
"Oh, yes. Thank you."
Yes?
"Oh, and Austin..."
"Thank you, Basil."
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
She's working on another lead right now.
"Where is Vanessa, by the way?"
"Right away, Exposition."
Be careful.
Yes?
"Oh, and Austin..."
"Thank you, Exposition."
Thanks.
Be careful.
Yes?
"Oh, and Austin..."
"Thank you, Exposition."
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
"No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter."
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
When do I begin?
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
"We won, Austin."
"A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over."
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
"Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!"
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Where am I?
"Thank you.  Let's go, baby!"
Be careful.
Yes?
"Oh, and Austin..."
Thank you.
"Good luck, Austin."
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
"We know all that, Exposition."
Groovy!
"Good on ya, man."
"Well, you can't always get what you want."
"Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?"
"Hey, Mick!"
"Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger."
Love is... love is... love is...
Why not? It's a question.
That does not compute.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
"Yes, I am programmed to answer any question."
"Man, you are one chilly square!"
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
"It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil."
"Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster."
"I've got you, Dr. Evil!"
"Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?"
"I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space."
What's wrong with your hand?
Behave!
Kiss me.
"That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa."
"I love you, Austin."
Lay it on me.
I have something to tell you.
I'll secure the perimeter.
"Austin, I'm coming with you."
Don't worry!
Are you crazy?
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
"Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs."
"I believe you, Austin. Let's go."
Likewise.
"It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys."
"Oh, behave!"
"Austin, what's your point?"
I'll hurry back.
"Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops."
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
What do we do now?
Fair enough.
Shut up.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Yes.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Indeed.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
"No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge."
"Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case."
"Not now, Austin."
Does that make you horny?
"Thank God, Austin, we made it."
"Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges."
"No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy."
You know who.
Who?
Do you think she's prettier than I?
"Out and about, doing odds and sods."
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
"Hello, luv."
"It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me."
Not in the Nineties.
"Only sailors use condoms, man."
"No, did you use a condom?"
"Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic."
"Of course, luv."
"Austin, may I have a word with you?"
"Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands."
"Really, Austin!"
I can't. You're drunk.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
"Oh, yes you are."
I am not.
"You're smashed, Vanessa."
"No, this is me in a nutshell."
"Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell."
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Go! Just go!
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
"Watch out, you're on my hair!"
I couldn't have another bite.
Fancy a nibble?
"You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa."
I hate having my picture taken.
"No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone..."
"Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped."
"Well, you know... cows, and shagging."
I don't get it.
"We can't just sit here, Austin."
He's too well-protected right now.
Let's go get him!
I never forget a pussy... cat.
How do you know?
"Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat."
Let me see.
A limousine has just pulled up.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Why?
"Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear."
Do you want to talk to him?
"Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?"
Why did you leave so soon?
I can't see a bloody thing.
"Here, use mine."
"I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses."
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
I'm sure.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
"Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing."
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
What?
Do I make you horny?
Sure.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
"You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro."
A Chigro?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
My meat and two veg.
I'm sorry?
My wedding tackle.
Excuse me?
I beg your pardon?
"That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?"
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
"My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much."
My mother's told me all about you.
"One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers."
"I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine."
"One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers."
That's not mine.
Danger's my middle name.
"It says here, name Danger Powers."
"Actually, my name's Austin Powers."
"Danger Powers, personal effects."
Where did you learn to shoot?
Noooooooooooooo!
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
"Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum."
Don't mind if I do.
"Here, have a piece of gum."
"Here, have a piece of gum."
"Hey, wait a minute--"
Everything seems to be in order.
Sure.
"Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?"
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
"Commander, I have to log it..."
What's its current position?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Shut up.
"Oh my God, he's back."
"It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir."
"What are you saying, son?"
Is it one of ours?
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Ow! You shot me!
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
"Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned."
We've got a lot of work to do.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Silence!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
They're mutated sea bass.
Right.
Sea bass.
What is it now?
"Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph."
Dr. Evil?
"Thank you, Herr Doctor."
Quite impressive.
"Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers."
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Yes.  Scott!
My son?
Yes.
"That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood."
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
"We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you."
"No, the boy's right. I really am evil."
"Evil, actually, Doctor Evil."
"Scott, don't say that..."
"I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent."
"Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!"
Show me.
What did you say?
Blow me.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I don't want to.
"No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?"
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
In due time.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
"Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers."
Yeah. What?
"And that's how you want to live your life, is it?"
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
"Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?"
An evil petting zoo?
"No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something."
An evil vet?
Not me.
"But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?"
Hi.
"Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?"
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
"Umm, that also has already happened."
"I love you, Vanessa."
"I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you."
"No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone."
"You didn't answer my question, Mum."
Did you ever want to?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever...
I just don't see it.
What about his teeth?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Why?
I'm proud of you.
"Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch."
You didn't...
He's asleep.
How's Austin?
Great.
"Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?"
Scott.
"No, he's really evil."
"We don't label people here, Scott."
"What do you want to do, Scott?"
I don't wanna take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't judge here.
"Well, it's kind of weird."
"So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?"
No need. I'll call again.
There are limits?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Seriously?
"Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --"
Really?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
"We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid."
"Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ..."
Would that I could say the Same.
So I'm still ...
Three days.
How long have I been here?
Peter ...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
Hope...
... love...
Secret ...
... preserve...
Nature ...
... power ...
Flower ...
... death ...
Love...
... death ...
Black...
Knight ...
... head ...
Red ...
... bottle ...
Sir August...?  What now?
"There, look!"
Promised? Who promised?
"Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised."
You mean you don't recall??
Have we met?
You
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Really -- what happened in 1922?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
I have an appointment.
Then you can't come in.
As you see.
You are female?
Impossible?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
"Mr. John Steed, please."
"May I help you, madam ..."
Then who wins?
"People, too."
Rules are made to be broken.
"Quite right, but we still make the rules."
This isn't a game.
We have met ...
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite a collection.
Eh? In here!
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
"Thank you, Steed."
"Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ..."
Next assignment?
"About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ..."
So am I.
To find out who killed my husband.
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Who?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
The Institute ... the funding ...
To you ... ?
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
We want to help...!
What are you trying to do to me?
Watch me.
"You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign."
I resign.
After the cold war ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
He tried to warn us ...
Ropes?
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
How curious ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
"Looks like rain, Steed..."
Hmmm ...
I'll never marry you.
Choices?
What are my choices?
Then what's stopping you?
The result would be ...
Such as?
You're mad.
Ring?
"Valentine, listen to me ..."
"You know, I believe she's actually jealous."
I'm already married ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
"Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ..."
'Our revels now are ended.'
But -- why?
"Of course. I planned that, too."
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Too many cooks --
You killed my husband.
An unholy trinity ...
"Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ..."
"Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ..."
You.
"Thanks, Valentine ..."
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
"Pity your mother came, too ..."
Our chaperon.
Not quite.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
"It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel."
"I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed."
As a matter of fact I have ...
Have you any place in mind?
Still a bit chilly ...
"A fine night, Mrs. Peel ..."
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
"The plot.  Hello, we must be going ..."
What kept you?
Mrs. Peel?
"If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --"
But --
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Where are you going?
I'll be back ...
Have a look at this.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
"They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel."
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Trubshaw again? What now?
Shall we?
You first.
"Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's."
What is it?
"Intoxicating. Here, have one of these."
It's called Black Leather.
What's that you're wearing?
Have we been invited?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
You didn't tell her?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
"We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ..."
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Aren't you coming?
You'll find out.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
"I'm a wanted woman, I know ..."
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
"... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children."
"Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ..."
No idea who. No idea why ...
You lied.
I told Mother I took care of you.
As far as you trust me.
You don't trust me?
"No, after you."
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Winning isn't everything.
I'm playing to win.
I thought you didn't.
I thought you played by the rules.
"Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?"
You're playing games.
Not for a moment.
But you did suspect me.
Is that all?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
It wasn't me; you have my word.
And do you trust me?
"... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust."
Yes ... ?
Always.  Except ...
Because you always obey orders ...
No trouble.
I could save you the trouble.
Nothing personal.
To kill me?
Orders.
You followed me.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Was I?
Where am I?
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Steed ... !
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
This must be the last straw.
Barely.
"What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?"
Do you always drive this fast?
"Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel."
Is that what you think?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
"... And by you, Mrs. Peel ..."
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
That's what we were working on.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Is there anything that isn't?
Not quite. This is my field.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
But
"For you, Mrs. Peel."
"She had this in her mouth. There, there..."
"Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ..."
Is that written in his shoe?
"Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ..."
Any ideas?
What on earth?
"Very good, Steed ..."
"Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ..."
How on earth can you tell?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
You mean my other self ...
"I must say, you look more your old self --"
Did you say formal? I must dress.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
"No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this."
Did he say who?
"Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel."
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Why should they think that?
I might say the same.
I wasn't about to.
Strange.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
"Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?"
Small talk.  Try the weather.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Any other vices?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
"June, July ... August?"
An eccentric recluse?
I meant me.
No thanks.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
For a man in my position --
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
As per mother's instructions.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
And I suppose you're the knight.
But why? What's the point?
"Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you."
Do you really think so?
"That place is so absurd, so out of date ..."
"Thank you, Trubshaw ..."
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
"Steed, we really must be --"
Or half cocked.
I thought we were on our way.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Do you?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
My father always wanted a boy.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
"We're not here to talk about the weather, surely."
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Mother?
I didn't. Mother did.
Much better.
"Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel."
And just what is the game?
"Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing."
Rules are made to be broken.
Whereas you are.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
"Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?"
1922. Why the kippers?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I was about to throw in the towel.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
"Doctor Peel, I presume?"
Decontamination -- ?
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
You don't believe him?
Where's Mother?
You're saying I have no choice.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
"You're not venturing alone, surely."
I shall need a small plane.
"Very good, Mrs. Peel ..."
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Privately owned by ...
... and now?
"Well, I can't possibly go like this."
I fail to see --
Getting to what?
I was getting to it.
Makes two of us.
Who's now vanished.
Surveillance? By whom?
I know all this.
Half-brother to be precise.
Peter's brother?  But --
"Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel."
I see.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
How did you guess?
Steed
"Dead, I'm afraid."
We want Mrs. Peel.
"Oh, hello ..."
So you say ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Global warming?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
In your operation.
Where?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Mother and Father know best.
Guilty until proven innocent?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
This man -- did you see him?
Impossible.
You.
Anyone particular in mind?
"How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?"
She may try to kill you.
Why?
"Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out."
Insane ... ?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Amnesia?
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Think she really killed those agents?
"Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --"
"You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely."
Weather's turning nasty.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
This way ...
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
"Both, actually."
You with Mother or Father?
She was ...
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I feel sure of it.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
"I think so, thank you so much ..."
"Are you alright, young man?"
Stay by the window. By the window.
"Let it be rain, please let it be --"
Walk over to the window ...
"No, please! I beg you ..."
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ugh ...
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
"Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --"
"You are, and it's behind you."
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Did I? My mistake.
You said ... one shot.
I do.
If you say so.
Rules are made to be broken.
That's not playing by the rules.
One shot -- for emergencies.
You wish.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
But did they teach you this?
I was at Harrow ...
You're better than I expected.
Perish the thought.
The last one you'll ever see.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
John Steed.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
"Deb, I want to throw you a shower."
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Does Cole know about this?
...Really?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
What's happening?
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
"Deb, we're pretending to be hookers."
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
That's what we're going to find out...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
You're kidding.
What do you mean?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
"Bobbie, what are you talking about?"
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Women!
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
"Chulo, one thing at a time."
"Where's the women, man? We gotta have women."
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
"Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads."
You're kidding.
What?
Yeah. What is it?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
"Hey, man, congratulations!"
"Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro."
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
"Man, you're losing your audience."
"Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France."
I've decided not to run for President.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
"Hey, you guys, what's going on?"
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
When do the girls get to the party?
All right!
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Fan out and look for them.
She's mine!
"Cole, what the hell are you doing?"
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
"Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?"
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Shit!
Maybe it had something to do.
"Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!"
So does Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
"Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?"
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
The car for Debbie?
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I'm very happy for you two.
I love that car.
The best.
Great car.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
"Ooh, be still, my heart."
I'm ready to make you another deal.
"Oh, come on, just a little."
I don't want any trouble.
"Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service."
"Rick, I want to talk to you."
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
"Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away."
What is this person's story here?
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm marrying Debbie.
"Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart..."
Not interested.
Seventy-five hundred.
No.
Five thousand dollars.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Cole...
I want Debbie.
Bond... James Bond.
And...
Fine. How's everything going?
Yes I did.
"Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?"
Mr. Thomerson.
Hello?
"Yes, sir."
1002.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
"Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?"
"Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir."
"Well, tell the asshole to shut up."
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
"What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you."
Keep me informed.
"Thanks for the advise, sir."
But how can I do that?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
I've tried to change her mind.
"Cole, I don't want you to give up on her."
"Yes, sir, I am."
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
"Thank you, sir."
Nice shot.
Sure have...
"So, Cole, you been practicing your game?"
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
"Hi, everybody. Am I late?"
"I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy."
"I'm going now, Cole."
"Cole, I'm sorry, I..."
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
"Cole, I'm marrying Rick."
"Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you..."
"No, Cole, I..."
"Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?"
"Cole, we've got to talk."
"Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse."
Cole?
You're so romantic...
Yeah.
Are you okay?
You're on.
Let's get naked.
"Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?"
Yes...
"You don't believe me? Okay, fine."
I don't believe you.
I am committed. I love you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
"Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly."
Let go of me!
"Rick, you're lying!"
"C'mon, I knew it was you."
I can't trust you!
Why don't you get undressed.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
"Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around."
I love you.
"Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap."
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
"Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her."
Your mother's not dead.
"Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave."
You're really pissing me off.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
"Remember, you promised... no screwing around."
"Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady."
Can't I just go with you guys?
"This is it, lady. Last stop."
Gonna get married...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
You better not have too much joy.
"Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland."
Um... that's very relaxing.
Good...
That feels so great.
C'mere.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
About what?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
What's the matter?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Oh... I got something for that.
I can't sleep.
Huh? Wha...
"Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy."
"Oh, those. Why do you ask?"
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
"No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home."
Are you going to have women at your party?
"Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however."
It looks awful.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
I think your dinner's burning.
What are we having?
But a fabulous cook.
"God, you're a slob."
I know what I'm doing... Go!
"Ilene, are you crazy?"
Let's go.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
"Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs."
"Ilene, Rick promised..."
"Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick."
I hope those guys are all right.
I hope Ilene's all right.
"Quiet, Mother."
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
"Ilene, we don't really know that."
A strange wang right in my palm.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Why is Cole here?
"Great, Mom."
"Any time, Al."
"Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it."
I think I screwed that one once.
Great bathing suit.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
A real turd.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
That's more like it.
Give him the works.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Why?
"I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?"
What are you...
"That's it, prick lips."
Screw you!
"They left an hour ago, pink nuts."
Your whores never showed up.
"What are you talking about, asshole?"
"Jumbo, where the hell are the women?"
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
"Park View Hotel, Room 1002."
Let's see your bread.
"So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop."
"Rick, I really think I'm in love."
"Gary, how we doing, big stallion?"
I didn't know you were into that.
Yes.
Hookers beat you up?
Screw that.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
It's true.
What's going on?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Let's have a toast.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
"Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?"
"Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody."
Let's go.
Screw you...
"Gary, you're quite an animal."
Milt?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I'll take some.
I want women.
"I'm telling you I am, Joe."
You're a pimp?
What can I be doing for you?
Good.
That's it.
Is that all the coke in the place?
"Larry, you and your wife got problems?"
"I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch."
"So, Larry, how have you been?"
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's Bullwinkle.
"Hi, guys. We brought back a friend."
"Ha, ha, ha."
I couldn't find any razor blades.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
What the hell are you doing?
"Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party."
Really?
"Yeah, I guess so."
You okay?
"No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now."
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
I just want to be alone.
"C'mon, Larry. Be good for you."
"Guys, I think I'd rather stay here."
"What do you mean, it changes?"
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Right.
"Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck."
You want to share it?
"Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!"
You're all under arrest. Open up!
"What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later."
It's on the tenth floor.
"Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002."
Are any of those right?
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
The end.
"Oh, no!"
Rick!
"Welcome, welcome, one and all."
Feel free.
"Mr. Thomerson, I..."
I'd love that.
"Rick, I want to cut through the b.s."
Can't I just maim it a little?
"Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it."
"All right, who serves?"
Oops!
It's all right...  So have I.
"No, Brett, I..."
You've been having strange sex...!
The phone made me do it!
Ed... you're kinky!
You can tell a man by his friends.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Of course.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm separated.
Mrs.?
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
You got it.
What's with her costume?
My Debbie?
Debbie.
Who?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Reach out and snort someone.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
What are you going to do about it?
"How about this, a Trojan donkey."
Who's your friend?
"Hey, you guys..."
Take care.
"Now, don't get into any trouble."
Very.
He look familiar?
Still drawing a blank.
How 'bout this?
Got me.
What's this?
I don't know.
Who was that?
"I'm proud of you, lad."
How'd it go?
That's the old Rick!
"If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics."
"Right in there, pal."
Oooooo.
"Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens."
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
About what?
"Rick, I'm concerned."
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
"So long, Father."
I think you'll enjoy this table.
The best table in the house.
Under the table!
My gift to you.
What the hell is that?
C'mon. I insist.
I'm not really hungry.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
This isn't right.
"Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican."
Then it's on to the real thing.
"Olivier's in that, right?"
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
What's the matter?
"Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight."
Where the hell is he?
Where'd she go?
"Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help."
"Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next."
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
"True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?"
"Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me."
"You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky."
Right... Think it over.
"Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is."
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
"I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse."
"You're late again, Rick."
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
I don't know.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Stevie... I...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
"-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --"
-- Knock it off!
"-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman."
"Aw man, Stephen, listen to me..."
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
"Let me take the lead, Stephen..."
"It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one."
"Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side."
"We're gonna be okay, man..."
Biggest in two battalions.
"Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?"
Yeah...
You know Knowlton pretty well?
No.  I need a drink.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
"It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it."
"No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on."
Wash it to the windows?
Be gentle.
Oh these moments do try me...
"-- Stephen, this is bullshit --"
-- He killed people --
"Just come down, John. Just --"
You gotta let me finish --
Did you do it for Tim?
He's alive.
Is he...
"John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see..."
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
"Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay."
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
"Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm..."
Shut up!
"You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?"
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
"We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen."
I'll handle it.
What are we going to do about this?
Anything else?
"They were for the fucking boat, Brian."
-- What were they doing there?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
How do you know?
I know.
-- What are you doing here?
"I don't know, Brian... I don't know..."
"Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?"
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
"Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian."
Everybody did.
"When dad died, I saw another fire..."
Saw what?
I saw it.
"It's okay, Stephen, I --"
"Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --"
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
You're selling dad's boat?
So hello.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Fuck you.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
"...Not now, Brian."
"Just leave me alone, okay?"
"Brian, look --"
Thanks for the insight.
"Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game."
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
You okay?
"Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us."
"Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team..."
Ready?
Roll the hose.
"You got a problem with drilling, probie?"
"What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time."
"What, are you kidding? By myself?"
Roll the hose.
Yeah... too bright...
This?
"C'mon, let's crawl home."
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Hey.
Hey.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Thanks.
-- Never mind.
"C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose..."
"What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right."
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Goddamn it Stephen!
"-- C'mon, Stephen."
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
"I'm in heaven, Lt."
"Ya love it, probie?"
"I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow."
"I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know."
"Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like."
Thanks for the speakers.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Hey! You don't know me --
"Why'd you come here, Brian?"
That was never proved.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Sheep don't count.
"Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors."
People actually used to pay you for this?
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
It works.
In the Field Museum once.
"What, you've never seen one before?"
"My God, an actual operating 8-track."
Been ripping off fire stations?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
I like what you've done with the place.
Not likely.
"Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother."
"So you're going to fight fires now, huh?"
"Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?"
Who asked you?
It doesn't go like that.
It's a small town.
"I'll see ya around, huh?"
I don't have the slightest idea...
What'll you do?
"I quit two days ago, Brian."
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
You're right.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I'm sorry.
Just take it.
What is --
"Your boss is lying, Jennifer."
Yes.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
You could check. It'd be in his files.
I don't know anything about it.
"We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --"
Hi.
Hi.
-- I work for the city.
Leave Stephen out of this --
"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
I was doing my job.
"Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --"
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Brian. What's wrong?
Uh huh.
I wanted to be a good one.
Then why did you quit?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Homey.
"Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies."
Got anything to drink in there?
Thanks for the invite.
"In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah."
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
"Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?"
Okay.
Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
"Well, you did invite me here."
You think that's really any of your business?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Hi.
"Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in..."
I could use a date.
"I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here."
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
How's it going?
Hey.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Arson.
Yeah...
"...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian."
So now you suddenly care about my future?
"C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth."
"Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that."
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
"Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?"
When I was twenty.
"With grenadine, right?"
"I don't want to be your friend, Brian."
"Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends."
Really? No kidding.
I work for city hall.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Huh.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Thanks for calling.
You look great.
You're back.
Jennifer.
Brian.
"Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?"
Oh Jesus Christ...
Who the fuck is doing this?
Trychticholorate.
"That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian."
The outlets.
What?
Sure you do.
I don't have a story.
"-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story."
Then who --
Who's doing this?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
"Hey, do I know you?"
See you Monday. Sir.
"Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year."
"I need another one, sir."
"If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --"
"I want another shot, Sir."
"If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing."
Like it never happened...
Yeah.
Your brother was a good man.
So what do you want me to do?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Just wondering.
No.
Did I say thanks?
Yeah.
Did you pull me out?
How ya feeling?
"Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now..."
Then who wrote the report?
Yeah? Airtight?
Nice bunch of guys.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Fire.
"In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?"
What the hell are you doing here?
Are you going public with this?
"No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point."
What reason?
But he killed these guys.
What?
"I don't work for them, either."
I don't guess.
But the right guess on this is arson.
And the putty around the door?
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""
Read.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"Uh, I don't think that's in my contract..."
No it couldn't.
-- Another backdraft.
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Glass?
What are you listening to?
-- Shhh.
Pest control.
Where are you going?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
"Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere."
Are you still here?
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
"Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant."
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
"Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April."
"Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?"
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
"Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?"
"Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid."
"That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant."
Four months?
Four months.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
You look like... Brian.
"Hi, Helen. Man, you look great."
Brian?
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Nice boat.
Mr. McCaffrey...
"Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young."
I have a job.
Every little boy's fantasy.
"No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin."
"No need to be modest, Brian."
"Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman."
Yeah. Big fan.
Swayzak's not my boss.
"So, you surviving without me?"
What?
Do you have to do that?
Backdraft.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
"Engine 115, right?"
Aren't you even curious?
What the hell are we waiting for?
Completely out of control.
"You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for ""Brian McCaffrey, Fireman""..."
I was ahead of my time.
"And just this year, ""Brian's Sound Spectrum"". Your own company even. Big step."
Coffee sucked.
"""Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards""?"
Management were pin heads.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
"It's in my blood, Willy."
Dad!
Cute.
Firehouse.
"Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?"
Fireman shit?
And DIE!
"Well, let's have a look."
"Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right."
Who's going to die?
"I'll be there, goddamn it!"
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there.
"We gotta roll, Stevie..."
"-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?"
He just wants to --
I'm busy.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
"I don't want to confuse him, Stephen."
"-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean..."
"Look, I'm sorry I --"
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
You can't keep being his father...
Yeah? When was the last time?
"Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong."
"I know he's out, but how's he doing?"
He's out.
"Coffee? Nah, I gotta go."
You want some coffee?
You treated me like shit.
I treated you better.
Okay.
He treats you okay?
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
The great communicator.
"Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something."
-- You remember.
"Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this."
"Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried..."
He's going to be a fireman.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's got piano lessons.
Where's Sean?
It's not your roof anymore.
Fixing my roof.
"Stephen, what are you doing here?"
Here we go...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
"Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?"
"Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean..."
That's your job.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
"McCaffrey, hold this for us."
"Anyway, down here, take a look..."
There's something else kinda interesting...
Putty? On both doors?
-- Burn it all.
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
Absolutely.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
"Nobody cares, Ronald."
Did he tell you how we finally met?
"Tell him about me, Shadow?"
Knock it off. Now.
I know you.
You don't know him.
"You like everybody, Ronald."
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
He works for me.
Who's this?
"Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal."
Didn't think you'd make it.
"How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?"
Shadow.
"I need that report, Lt."
It knows us. This one knows us.
I might.
You don't know... nobody knows...
"What do you listen to, Stephen?"
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
I'm working on it.
Got a cause?
I'm a little busy right now --
Investigator...
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
Just catch the son of a bitch.
"Is there a connection between them, Alderman?"
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
"No Marty, I don't."
Don't you have any leads at all?
"""Don?"""
"When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?"
Alderman.
Inspector.
I need to get in the trunk.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman Swayzak.
I'm a Catholic.
"""The Strawberries""?"
You mean you could use it.
"But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread..."
Who?
Nah...
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Yeah.
"C'mere. You got some good blow, right?"
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Who?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Why?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Yeah.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
People.
What's to believe?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
So what are you doing here?
I was gonna bring it back myself.
"Are you all right, honey?"
Yes.
Yes.
You took the chalice.
"I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool."
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
"How are you doing, man?"
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
"The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide."
"That stuff'll kill you quick, man."
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Me?
I forgive you.
"Yeah, sucker. You better be there!"
"Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!"
"Oh, really?"
Let me think about it.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
"All right, cop. I want my money."
Large?
You've really got a problem.
That 50 G could help you --
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
What case?
How's the case going?
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
"Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game."
This psycho can.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
Don't bullshit me.
What money?
Do you have the money?
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Yeah. I'm sure.
Are you sure?
How about 7 1/2?
I want 15 on the Mets.
All right. What are you gonna do?
"Yes, Sister?"
"I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer."
"Yo Black, you looking for trouble."
You truly are a dancing fool.
Did he gots to be.
He gots to be did.
"1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat."
"Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!"
...Benedict Arnold...
I'm on it.
Keep trying.
B-L-A-K it is.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
How 'bout...
"Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint."
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Let's go niggers!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
YEAH!
Yeah!
Ho!
Everybody say Ho!
That's mighty black of you.
You don't have the demographics.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
"Yeah, him."
Delacroix.
Please.
Who are you revolting against?
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
"Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece."
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Give me some?
Well you did.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
We're ready when you are.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
What's your name?
"The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's."
"And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better..."
I'm a revolutionary.
What do you do?
What do I do?
"And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?"
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
"Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent."
You can walk away.  We both can.
"Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players."
You're in this up till ya neck.
Damn skippy.
So that's what you been doing?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
I'm out.
Meaning?
"Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid."
What are you talkin' about?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Look at my lips.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
"In fact, we never knew she had any friends period."
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
"Please, have a seat."
Must be the pressure.
What's wrong with him?
You ain't happy about the green light?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
"Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you."
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
"Seconds and thirds, too."
What's that?
She's also moorish.
"Certified ladies' man, huh?"
"It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face."
"Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins."
I'm not smiling.
Why are you smiling so?
You might be right.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
That can be done.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
And this is Manray.
Nice to meet you.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Different.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
How much?
Manray needs a job.
No offense.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
De-la-croix.
"Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot."
"Good morning, Cheeba."
"DeLa, I don't know 'bout this."
That ain't funny.
We're starving.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We was coming to see you.
I'm tired of waiting.
And I'm the feet.
"Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit."
"Ahh, the luxuries of life."
Did we get our bill yet?
"Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO."
"My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon."
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
No costume.  No blackface.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I won't do it anymore.
How you sound?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Mantan!!
Mantan?
You have to start getting into your character.
Why?
You're now Mantan.
To what?
I would like to change your name.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
How different?
Where do I sign?
"Some tap dancing, some singing."
What do I have to do?
EUREKA!!
My tap shoes.
Well do something about it.
"Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street."
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
But the line has to be drawn.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
"I gots to go, it's my Moms."
"Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call."
"Hold on a sec, I got a call."
This has to be a big mistake.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
"Calm down, please."
"Dunwitty, don't leave."
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
"In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!"
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
"Besides, what does he know about Negroes?"
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
"Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?"
We think so.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I don't know about that plantation angle.
"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
Who are the other characters?
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
"This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
"Yep, you guessed it."
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Exactly!
"Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky."
What are there character traits?
That's a great handle.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
I'm feelin' dis'!
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
The name of the show?
Word!!!
Go on.  Good so far.
I'm wid it.
"Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right."
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
I've never been given a fair shot.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I'm telling you it's not.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
"I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed."
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Four minutes ago.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I'm sorry I'm late.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Always keep 'em laughing.
"I love you too, Daddy."
Let's get him over to the bed.
"I didn't mean that, in life."
"Three nights Charleston, South Carolina."
Where do you go from here?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
"The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through."
"Enough about me, what's happening with you?"
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
That's what I'm askin'.
How did you end up here?
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
"Daddy, she's younger than me."
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Pleased to meet you.
"Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT."
It's been a long time.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
"It's me, Peerless."
"Go away, unless you got my money."
I want to speak with you.
What do you want?
He never showed it.
Your father is proud of you.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
So what's up with you?
"The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it."
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
How long has my father been like this?
Is that so?
"Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about."
Give me the gun.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Don't make me have to use this.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
"DeLa, kiss my big black ass."
Work related or otherwise?
"That was a mistake, but I don't regret it."
That's why it will be so much fun.
This is crazy.
Light?
"DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light."
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
Please don't go there.
"Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?"
He's just playing big brother.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
I don't want to hear it.
Why'd you do that?
How so?
Is that good or bad?
I thought it was appropiate.
Thanks.
"This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century."
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
For what?
A gift.
What is this?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
"So you have your small victory, now what?"
Everybody shut up.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
"I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny."
Who's side are you on?
The pleasure is mine.
Same here.
Just don't lie to me.
What do you want me to say?
We both lied to him.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Your life will never be the same.
Break a leg.
Just want to say good luck.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
You've said that already.
The big one.
Which one is your brother?
This is the group I was telling you about.
Hello.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
What is your problem?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
You okay?
This is Cheeba.
Hello.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
I'm in till the end.
You getting cold feet?
Sounds risky to me.
What point is that?
You lost me.
"Not yet, but this thing will never get made."
Do you know how you will use him?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How did you know?
Manray!
Manray!
"It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known."
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Nobody told me anything.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
How was it?
"I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
"Oh, is that what I'm doing?"
"Hi, Mona."
"He, I'm Mona."
"Yes, your name?"
"My name is Manray, goddamnit."
"Mantan, we got a show to tape."
I don't believe it.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
What you did is dead wrong.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
Yeah.
"Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece."
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
No.
In time.
No joke.  Serious.
Same thing Giuliani said.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
You sound like the media.
So they can be on TV.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
I feel fine.
"You feel good, not nervous?"
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Can I kiss you too?
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Soon.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
You know how your Daddy is.
Not at all?
No.
"Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?"
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
"Peerless, last time, go see your father."
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
"Regardless, he still is your father."
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I can't go all the way down south.
"He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia."
Where is he?
Yes he did.
He said that?
He wants you to come and see him.
I'll be right over.
"Peerless, your father called."
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
"Mommy, please don't call me that."
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
"That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?"
How's the food?
"C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff."
It looks delicious.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
"Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show."
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
"This is a TV show, not a music video."
"My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?"
How did you get this gig?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
What's a Negro.
"You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?"
Finland.
"Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland."
Where are you from?
I just turned twenty.
Yes you!
Thank you.  And always smile.
Let Myrna finish.
"We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing."
The best defense is offense.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
"If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you."
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
What do you mean?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
You sing and dance?
"Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself."
"You've never had any formal training, either?"
I never had a really real pair before.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Money and nothing else?
I'm more comfortable around my people.
"Tavis, thank you for having me."
"Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in."
A song a comin' I feel.
I feel a song a comin' on.
"Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper."
"Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle."
I don't know who I am.
How be dat?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
"Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me."
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
I slept too near where I fell out.
You slept too near where you got in?
I fell out of my bed last night.
...like fried and chicken...
...like grits and butter...
...like macaroni and cheese...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...perfect...
"...too late, maybe around..."
...then what about...
...too early...
Around...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...not that time...
"...I heard different, thought that was..."
...yes she did.
"...no, she didn't..."
"Oh, because on our first date, she let me..."
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
I heard ya lady is wild.
We should go out on a double date.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
"...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round..."
I thought you got rid of...
"Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for..."
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
"...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose."
"Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose..."
"Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy..."
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
She hates dem.
"No, not that.  How 'bout..."
Oh her.
"Not her, the one with the little..."
The one with da big...
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
You tellin' the truth.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
"Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat."
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
To come back to our roots.
"...the big apple, New York, New York."
"We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem..."
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
"I wuz leaving anyway, for good."
You can go now.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Why don't you answer?
Don't try to change to the subject.
"Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?"
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
"Aw, c'mon."
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
"Say what, Manray?"
"Oh, you gonna make me say it."
Just ask me what you want to know.
Stop playing me Sloan.
And what?
And?
You leave something out?
How did you get this gig?
You look beautiful like that.
What?
Y'know what?
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
My people love me.
You're sure this is a good idea.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
Why don't you call him?
We can look out for ourselves.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Maybe you need to start.
Never read a book in my whole life.
"You don't read, do you?"
"No, before my time."
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Just a little something' somethin'.
"Oh you do, huh?"
"Sloan, I got it like 'dat."
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Are you trying to rap to me?
What else?
The good stuff.
What do you want to know?
So what's up with you?
Enough.
A lot?
"Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral."
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
That is none of your business.
Where are you bound for?
Good morning.
"Good day to you, young sir."
"Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?"
"I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I."
Both of us ride home with Best here.
"If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best."
I never was more in earnest.
"Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking."
"Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?"
And his baggage?
"Not yet, but I believe he intends to."
Has he sent the challenge yet?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
"Only a very little, as soldiers do."
"What is the service, sir?"
"How do you do, sir?"
Neither!
"Sir, I'm a British officer."
I have acted as I think fit.
"Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly."
Where's the beauty you promised me?
"The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers."
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
"Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you."
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
"Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady..."
O'Grady.
What is your uncle's name?
The coward!
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
It must have been some other gate.
I'll match any man with the sword.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Your cousins go out with him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Have you taken my message to him?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
And so I am.
"Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word."
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
"Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body."
"You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!"
"Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!"
"Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?"
I have heard of them.
"Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown."
"Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won."
I don't know.
"Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me."
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
I have no luggage.
As you please.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Your honor must lower his voice.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Good gracious!  What is this?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
"Where is my rascal, Lazlo?"
"Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble."
Certain?
"I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him."
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
"But how, sir?"
"But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?"
I have faced that problem before.
I believe they will deport you.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
"I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill."
Only the agency of servants.
Who else can give me information about you?
For whom else have you worked?
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
"Yes, sir."
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
"Yes, sir.  Here is my letter."
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
"Take to your legs, low Irish dog."
That is a trifle strong.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Then you yield to me.
"Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her."
"Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?"
Old fool!
"Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool."
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Will we always leave it at this?
"Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?"
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
It is my only object.
You want my heart?
"By loving you, with no hope of possessing you."
How so?
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
"It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love."
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
"That man has, perhaps, not yet been born."
Have you not a man whom you value?
Not one.
Not even that.
"But, for a time... a passing fancy?"
Never.
Have you had one?
No.
"What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?"
"I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them."
"But you refused me, Dorothy."
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
Then you must get it.
I feel the ribbon.
Agreed.
"All right, five hundred guineas."
"Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more."
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
"All the same, you must name an amount."
"Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly."
As much as possible?
As much as possible.
Yes!
"Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?"
By name only.
"Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?"
What is to be done?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
When is he to go?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
The Prince left him only that choice.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Hmm-mmmm.
Was he cheated?
Does this assignment interest you?
"That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins."
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
"But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?"
"What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?"
I see.
"Yes, of course."
May I be quite frank with you?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
"I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe."
"Yes, he's fine."
"Is he all right, papa?"
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
"Yes, papa."
Yes?
Papa?
"Good night, my little darling."
"Good night, papa."
"Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?"
"But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?"
"Did you buy the horse, papa?"
"Sir, let those laugh that win."
"I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?"
I beg your pardon?
"Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?"
The milkmaid's daughter?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Tender Hegenheim.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
"He loves me, as I love you."
He is only curious to know who you are.
And he doesn't care about me?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Dark Valdez.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Who?
Bill Styles...
"Hurricane kept you up, too?"
"Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
"Yeah, if you've slept."
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Can I at least have a drink?
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
"Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me."
You framed-him...
"Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --"
He is the only one unaccounted for.
"Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go."
What about Pike?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Did -- did you --
Fine.
I don't want to go --
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
What do we do?
"Fuck, what the fuck is going on --"
"A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?"
I'm -- I'm sorry...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
"Shut up, Mueller."
"West was one thing, but this --"
HEY!
"Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP."
I don't know!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
"We got -- I don't know, we got separated"
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We found him like this --
Can anybody hear me!
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You too?
Shut up.  West's dead.
"Yeah, right..."
We found him like this...
"Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?"
"What do you mean, alone?"
"What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --"
We don't know. West is dead.
He's telling the truth up to a point...
"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
"You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good."
And the bodies?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Do what?
He -- He made me do it --
Jesus!
"Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --"
We've found all of them.
We don't need the tapes --
You wanna bet?
We're not finished yet --
But not Pike's.
You saved Kendall's life --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Yeah --
And he'd been shot.
Of course --
You saw West's body.
I apologize --
"Yeah, we know, Pike did."
I didn't shoot West --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I'm serious --
He's lying.
That'd be my reaction too --
That son of a bitch.
"You smoke, Ray?"
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Tell me about them.
Some.
I'm not telling you what happened.
"Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?"
Okay.
"They're dead, aren't they?"
There's no need...
You did Basic here?
I don't know... I like the Army.
What do you like then?
I just don't like it.
"Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty."
It's... too slow.
"You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?"
I asked for a policeman.
Why not?
How do you know that?
"Ohhhh, I don't think so..."
"Can't do that now, though, can you?"
Where's the cabin?
Would you have believed me?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Yeah.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Back up.
What about the phosphorous grenade?
The creek bed --
Where?
What business?
"No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?"
He said he worked there --
Epilepsy.
"He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?"
There were six of us...
"Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out."
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
"Your weapons, Sergeant."
What the fuck is going on?
"The rest of you, fallout for physicals!"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?"
"Sir, Dunbar, sir!"
"Cadet, what's your name!"
I...
So you killed him?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
West... he's dead.
"Jesus, what happened?"
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Why?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Put it down!
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
What don't you know?
I... I don't know...
They?
His chest was hamburger --
From up close or far away?
Full clip to the body --
"You saw West, right? How was he killed?"
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
You're lying --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
Just look. Little pocket.
Why?
Look in my pack.
Bullshit.
"You hated West, Mueller loved him --"
"Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?"
That's exactly what he says about you.
"Oh, come on --"
Mueller.
"If not you, then who?"
You're the only one missing a grenade.
"Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --"
You hated West more than any of us.
"You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray."
Yeah...
Right?
Do I?
You know it's not like that --
Why?
We just want to check your pack --
"Roberto, what the fuck?"
"Where have you been, Jay?"
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
"What do you mean, West's?"
West's. Any kindling for afire?
"Whose blood is that, Jay?"
Maybe he...
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe --
Where are they!
I don't know --
I didn't --
Because I was standing next to him.
How do you know?
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Why?
I didn't do anything --
"Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --"
"Something funny, Levi?"
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Well?
"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""
No. I said Dunbar.
Is it the truth?
My heart weeps.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Stop.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Mr. Hardy?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Why did he come back for you?
He admitted it.
"No. Poetic justice, though."
But you didn't.
Then who did?
I didn't kill him --
"What happened to ""degrees""?"
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
"But not the only victim, right?"
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Get your hands away from the desk!
"For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --"
You're crazy --
Not for long.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
That's preposterous --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Stay where you are.
"I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this."
You're drunk --
What are you talking about?
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
"You're a good soldier, Bill."
"I'm sorry, Bill."
The Senator...
"They're taking your command, aren't they?"
You think you could explain all this to me?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
That's horseshit and you know it.
Does Osborne agree?
Yeah.
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
What I said before --
What the hell are you talking about --
What about the confession?
"Home, I'm done."
"Tom, where are you going --"
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
You mean not enough to save you.
Not for me.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Nevertheless --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
"There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it."
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Who killed Pike?
"Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez."
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
"And I'm the closest thing to it, right?"
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
And the problem is you only got three.
"Well, he's a good soldier."
"It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West."
Tell me what I can do.
That bad?
What kind of trouble are you in?
How are you?
"Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks."
He was your friend.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Your phone number?
Yeah.
I should probably write that down.
Want company?
Nah.
Think it'll work?
"Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened."
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
What are you doing out here?
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Do I have a choice in this?
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
West?
Really.
"You're a good man, Hardy."
"There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees."
That's not true.
Tough.
What if I don't want it?
This isn't the time --
What?
Seven.
We need to talk --
No death certificates. No crime.
"No bodies, no West..."
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
"Hardy, for Chrissakes --"
Isn't this how your story goes?
"Hardy, what are you doing --"
Right back where we started.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Get in.
Four --
"Good, just making sure."
No.
We were close to something with Kendall.
That's gonna stay my secret.
For what?
"You know, you never told me why you left the army."
Nah.
Think it'll work?
"Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened."
So what now?
So did I.
Yeah.
You wanted to break him.
You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to get the truth.
"Yeah, I could've. Should've."
You couldn't have known --
I pushed him too hard.
That's a fantastic idea --
Good idea.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
"Positive. Hardy, they planned this."
Are you sure?
What?
They got their stories straight.
"We're fucked, I know --"
Let's go talk to Bill...
Little bit.
That bugs you too?
Buttfucks the cabin?
"Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --"
"And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world."
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Dunbar.
What happened next?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What?
I didn't shoot West...
Why do you care?
But you will.
"Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?"
Watch me.
"Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --"
"Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --"
I don't know.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
"Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne."
I don't think that has anything to do with --
"""Too neat."" How long have you been an investigator?"
I lied. Wait for it...
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight."
That was kid gloves?
Got it.
"Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves."
Not the happiest of memories?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Something wrong?
What point?
"He's telling the truth, up to a point."
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
So noted.
You're off to a late start.
I plan to grow on you.
The very same.
"This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?"
You're kidding.
I lost a bet.
Something like that. You?
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
What is that?
Best time for banal chit-chat.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You made me look like an idiot --
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Baseball?
"The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --"
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Something like that.
Good cop/bad cop?
That is the most unprofessional --
Is Dunbar cute?
Excuse me?
Why?
Move him.
Yes.
He's in interrogation?
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
"Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio."
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
"Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?"
"It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --"
You and the Colonel go back.
"Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --"
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
You knew Sergeant West?
"Ah, Christ"
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Hostile and uncooperative.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
"Pike, please --"
I don't think I want to hear this --
How?
What are you talking about?
So you took off your shirt?
I was freezing from the hurricane --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
"Oh, you remember now --"
"I remember now, it was before the explosion --"
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
Pike and I got separated --
Poor fucker my ass...
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
We should tell him we're not going.
"You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?"
"You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?"
The faggot speaks.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What happened with Nunez?
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
Childs.
"Who, Levi --"
Wrong answer --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
What.
Wait --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
It won't work --
What?
You can't threaten me --
Dunbar says you were.
Pike never confessed.
Fifty minutes.
"We've been making progress, I see."
Pike never confessed.
"But you didn't see it, right?"
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
He whispered it in my ear.
No one else heard it?
"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
He said what?
He wanted more than that.
We just want --
Tell him to shut up --
Shut up!
Bullshit --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
The fuck are you talking about --
We're not going anywhere.
"Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --"
I used it to start the fire --
"Where's your shirt, Mueller?"
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
"This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --"
What the fuck are you doing?
Thank God...
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
What the fuck happened to you --
"Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit."
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
"Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black."
So?
"You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right."
"No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --"
Yeah.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
What happens to Dunbar now?
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
We know.
"You want Kendall, don't you?"
It's too neat.
What do you think?
No --
You think he did it?
Then it's unofficial.
"He's not Army, it's not official --"
"But this guy you called, he's not even Army --"
"He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman."
This is totally unnecessary --
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"Sir, yes, sir!"
"Good luck, kid."
Thank you.
There's only one I want.
That would explain the indigestion.
"A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead."
"Didn't kill anything, did I?"
"Sorry, kid. I don't do charity."
Someone stole my backpack.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Who is she? Where does she live?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Yes!
"Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?"
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
See! The big guy likes it.
That's great.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
"Great, great. That's fantastic."
I don't expect to.
You won't find a better place!
No one's ever left.
Why?
I have to leave. Tonight.
It truly is.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
What is this place?
Not yet.
You were expecting me?
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Yes.
Bloom like a flower?
Edward Bloom.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Don.
Bloom!
Let's see it.
I brought it.
You get the eye?
"Fine, I'm doing it."
"Fine, you do it."
"Fine, I will."
Then do it.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Or are you too scared?
No.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
How would you describe him?
Thirty years. Maybe more.
How long have you known my father?
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Can I see him?
A pleasure.
"Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine."
Will.
"I'm sorry, Jenny. I am."
Lucky girl.
I know.
Go.
I'll...
Please. Go. Just go.
"Lord, I'm sorry I..."
I can get it. I can just...
"It's okay, just leave it."
I see. I thank you for your time.
"I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom."
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Helping people makes me happy.
"In so many words, yes."
So I've heard.
How did you know?
You must be Edward Bloom.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Promise me you'll come back.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Eighteen.
How old are you?
"It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her."
Yeah.
Was she nekkid?
"Well, she... uh..."
What did she look like?
Did you see that woman?
And I like you.
I like your stories.
You were talking about your wedding.
There was one time when I was eleven...
"Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why."
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
"Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication."
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
"Well, it's not a short one."
"Oh, so this is a tall tale?"
I never knew.
Please?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Can I take your picture?
Spooning the sherbet.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Stop.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
"No, I understand."
"Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."
That's terrible.
What were you dreaming about?
I was dreaming.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Really.
"Just to be sure, you can take my pack."
You're not trying to run away?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Beats me.
What did she say?
Okay.
Okay.
You don't like it?
Karl.
"What's your name, Giant?"
I can.
Really?
Yes. Exactly.
Story of my life.
It's unbelievable.
The River!
You say...
Where are we headed?
"Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say..."
Let's get out of here.
Okay. Okay.
Like this.
"I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts."
How I go.
How what happens?
Tell me how it happens.
The river?
The river.
"Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once."
"What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?"
"It would kill you, huh?"
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
You think I'm fake.
"What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?"
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
What?
Dad!
"Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?"
Can we talk?
Son?
Dad?
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
I think someone hasn't.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Yes.
Did I ever tell you about how...
"Oh, so you know."
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
"Why not religion, Dad?"
I thought you weren't dying.
You know where the chemicals are?
I will.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
"You mean, while I'm here."
"Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here."
You're right.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
When did you ever work in an office?
True story.
Really.
You owe me three-fifty.
What did he say?
Okay.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
So how does it happen?
"No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic."
She was a witch.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
Really.
You learned from the best.
You think I'm up for it?
Did you do any of that?
Am I?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
I'm not scared.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
The one about the witch.
"Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story."
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Jesus Christ.
"What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?"
Make him stop.
I was drying out.
Go out with me.
How can I convince you to stop?
I have the rest of my life to find out.
You don't even know me.
How did you get so many?
They're your favorite flower.
Daffodils?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it."
'Fraid so.
This is it? The whole vault.
I'm robbing this place.
So what are you up to now?
"That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped."
I don't believe it!
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
"Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?"
This is why you don't show work in progress.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
Really.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
There is no softer ground than town.
Wait! I need those!
You didn't become crazy.
Because he's dying.
Were you and my father having an affair?
How did you know my father?
Are you Jenny Hill?
I wasn't expecting you.
Hello.
Oh. Oh.
I do.
"Do you like it, being pregnant?"
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm going to check on him.
I'll help you.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Yes.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Is he going to be okay?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
What happened?
I need you on my side.
You're not.
"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
But it's not true.
Do you love him?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Do you love your father?
"Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman."
"Mmm, what?"
Mmm.
But it's romantic.
That's because most of it never happened.
They met at Auburn.
You never told me how your parents met.
Did you?
I talked with your father last night.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
Probably tonight.
You need to go.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
It's bad.
Yes. Thank you.
"Mom, do you want some time with Dad?"
That's okay?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
So you never bought any land.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Yes?
Mom?
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Is he awake?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
That really happened?
Do you know who that is?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Was she one of your teachers?
"Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair."
"But I understand you, Mom. I always have."
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Yes. But that's a different...
Would you say you understand Josephine?
"Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know."
Yes.
Of course.
"Mom, would you say you understand Dad?"
Really! That's wonderful.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
How much time does he have left?
How is he?
He's up with your father.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
We rented a car.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
"We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really."
How did you get here?
The sets were good.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Yeah it was okay.
I paid for those guitar cases.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Such as?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
No I don't.
You know what for.
What for?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You first.
No I haven't.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Leave him!
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
What are you doing here?
What? What are you doing?
Name it.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
What?
Thank you.
Say thank you.
Yeah.
Do you like it?
It is. I did it cooking.
That's not a burn.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
What's this?
We'll stop then.
Yes.
Do you want to stop?
"You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop."
What do you mean?
It's enough isn't it?
There's over eighty thousand here.
"Sixty four thousand, eight hundred."
Right.
Hello.
Uh... Yes.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Right.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Ch...
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Just leave her alone.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants a lot of money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
He wants money.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
What did he say? Tell me!
What? What does he want?
John.
Put the fucking kettle down.
Good night.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
You can stay tonight.
I understand. I'm so sorry
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
How is bank?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Do you believe in love?
No. It's not that.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Tell me what he said.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me.
Oh nothing.
What was that?
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Binoculars.
I...
"""I saw you waiting there, by the gate."""
When?
What?
She says she has a secret to tell.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Uh. Do you like England?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
"No, no..."
You're asking for my documents?
You must have a visa or something...
"Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth."
So how long will you be in England?
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
What was that?
So?
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
No.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
"Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem."
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Hold on.
And...
Good.
Yes. I know.
Oh.  We are Russian.
I need to know who you are first please.
He says he feels safe here.
What did he say?
What?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Sorry. You've lost me...
What are you doing here?
"You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates."
"Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?"
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
My name's Sophia.
Right.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Maybe you will find out.
What does it mean?
Tell me about it.
It's a long way to go for a date.
It's more like a date.
No. What? No. I know.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Why?
It's what you came back for.
It's not mine either.
It's not mine.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Okay. Promise?
Something else.
Goodbye.
Okay. Goodbye.
Because it was a lie.
Please. Why not?
Yeah. No thanks.
Whatever.
Okay. Thank you.
No. I think I better just go.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
It's alright.
You know you can come under the blanket.
What's your name?
What was her name?
I don't know.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't want anyone to die.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I'm trying to quit.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Laugh it up.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
She's alive?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
What?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What?
What happened between you and the blonde?
Not really. Maybe a little.
Are you scared?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Well what have you got?
I don't have nothing.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Thank Christ for that.
"The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans."
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
I wasn't saying anything.
"Please, there's no... Oh."
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You don't have to say anything
"You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world."
Get out.
You are throwing me out.
Get out
Excuse me?
You don't understand you either.
You don't understand me.
"So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?"
It wasn't what I wanted.
You didn't mind too much.
I got what I paid for.
You...
What?
"I think it's my safest bet, don't you?"
So now you hate all women?
Why?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
"There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John."
Some... What does that mean?
Sometimes neither.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
And who says what is wrong.
And. It's wrong.
And? What are you saying?
I don't hate you.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
We'll pretend it never happened.
Okay we won't talk about it.
No.
You don't want to talk about it.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Why not?
I don't want to talk about it.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Excuse me?
He will come back.
"But, you know, so what?"
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Oh Jesus.
So uh...
It's none of your business.
Fine.
I don't want to talk about him.
"So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name..."
I said I don't have any.
What?
I don't have any money.
Give me some money.
Yes.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
What?
Have you got your passport?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What? No you're not..
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
Where's the restroom?
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
In every sense. If at all possible.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I do. I want to very badly.
I know you just want to punish me --
In the world.
No I don't.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
Well as it turns out I did.
So what are you going to do?
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I don't want to know.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
You don't understand anything.
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
What's wrong?
They go. John. They go.
Yes I know.
"""Frenzy""."
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Syevodnya
Syevodnya?
Happy bath day.
I don't understand.
Sorry?
Today is bath day.
Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
"And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?"
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
"I mean... ""Ants."" ""I've got a problem with ants."""
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Is that everything?
Cash.
How do you want to pay?
Thanks.
You have excellent English.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Is the flight full?
"Yes, ma'am."
Then start taking them seriously.
"Yeah, I know."
"You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?"
Just wanted to see.
What are you doing?
I do. God's truth. I do.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Can I come in?
More cough syrup?
I need ya help again.
What do you need?
Hey.
"Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy."
When? Now? Oh. No.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
At church?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
That'd be nice.
You liked what I brung ya?
I bet you have loyal customers.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
This was very sweet of you.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You didn't have to do this.
Don't make it less true.
Not if no one finds out.
This gonna get you in trouble?
"Oh, she older than that."
Is your niece older than 12?
You take her to a doctor?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
"Go on, Laz. You can talk to me."
I need to uh...
Yes?
Angela?
Well. It's good to see you.
You hurt it?
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Lazarus?
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
"He black alright, he just ain't blue."
Okay.
Can I put it in your mouth?
"No, ma'am."
"You ain't the kicker, are you?"
Hey.
Hi.
"I'll take a jar of that, too."
For your hands?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
"Mind I ask, what's all this business here?"
"Well, that makes it easier."
"That young lady's size, right'cher."
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You gonna steal my truck?
Now wait...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
"That's not right, really, cuz I..."
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You need a ride?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You been home yet?
She's around. Always is.
What happened?
"Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here."
Sure.
"Sit down, man. Need a beer?"
Yeah.
Holy shit.
You gonna miss your bus.
"Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay."
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Still need a lift?
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
The fuck you laughin' at?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I got others.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Stop what?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
You go to hell.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Yeah.
Better?
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
You wanna go home?
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
"You better pray, gal. You better pray..."
"LAZ, I said let...!"
Let go of my arm...
Let go...
"God forgive you, for how you done me..."
I don't love ya no more.
"If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's..."
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Rose... please...
Better than what you give.
Better'n me?
I deserve better than this.
Kept us warm for twelve years.
I keep the heat on.
And you gonna live it with him?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
"How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?"
"Think this about money still, ya old fool?"
"Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?"
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Like a man.
Don't... don't say that to me...
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
"GODDAMMIT, RAE!"
"You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?"
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
"You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill.."
You sayin' you'll do what?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
"Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?"
Or what? OR WHAT?
"Careful how you point that gun, boy."
YOU SHUT UP!
Maybe I won't.
I don't want you to let go.
"Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?"
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Get a good picture in your mind.
What I love.
"No, you do it. I can't sing."
"Go'on and sing it, I'll play."
I know that.
How you feelin' today?
"Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head."
Looks like you know a song.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I guess you have.
"Yeah, gal I been here before."
You can handle it.
By myself?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Nothin'.
What is it?
I tried.
"You took care of your wife, like you do me?"
"I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff."
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Where you gonna be?
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
"Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times."
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
The... chain helps.
Tell me what to do.
I'm here with you.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Anything.
Could you do somethin' for me?
I ain't in a hurry.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
No joke.
Still makin' jokes?
To freedom.
We drinkin' buddies now?
Want another?
Sure.
You take it straight?
You drink whiskey?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
"Well, get to it."
I can handle that.
I don't fuckin' cook.
Uh-uh.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Let go of me...
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Uh-uh.
Itches.
Uh-uh.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
I CAN'T!
I said... STOP!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
"No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness."
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Whose doin' is that?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Or what?
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
LET ME GO!
"In my house, you watch that lip..."
"Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me..."
No ma'am.
You some kind'a pervert?
What do you want?
"Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?"
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
What?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
"Gal, you ain't right yet."
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Why you got me chained?
Let me say somethin' first...
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Don't need none.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Wait. He left.
Well I don't...
Where's Ronnie?
Two days?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
How long... how long I been out?
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
"Come on, gal..."
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Teh... Tehronne?
Like I told you.
How a girl get like that?
Nuh-uh.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Go ask him.
Naw!
He tapped that.
Uh-huh.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
"Now, hold up."
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Why you say that?
Shit. Who hasn't?
This Rae... you get with her?
Huh?
You need some weed?
Word wit'cha. In private.
I do.
"I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll."
"Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door."
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Heard about this morning.
The hell is this shit?
"She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other."
Then what?
Not like that.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Ask the chef.
This all looks wonderful.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
"Pass them potatoes, Lincoln."
"One thing at a time, Laz."
"You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit."
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
What's that chain around her for?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
"A naked woman, chained in ya house?"
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
I told you to TURN BACK!
Or what?
Ain't gonna be moved?
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
"You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time."
Goin' dove huntin'?
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
You get a call from Rose?
Why's his britches round his knees?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
"I didn't start this, R.L."
"Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat."
I skipped lunch.
"You struck some gold, didn't ya?"
Yes'sir.
So...  That your first time?
Please don't tell my daddy.
Why she got a chain on her?
Keep the change on that.
Yes'sir.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
"Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel."
What's on your mind?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
You could put it that way.
That's right.
You a preacher?
Thank you.
Ronnie...
"Ronnie. Please, baby..."
"Yeah, I do."
I feel better. Do you?
I'm a what?
"Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star."
What?
Holy shit!
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Are you wasted?
Yeah?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
"Yeah, I know."
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
You feelin' sick?
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Hey.
Hey.
Rae!
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Rae don't do this now...
Rae...
This ain't gonna work.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
The hell are you talkin' about?
"I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all."
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I just wanted some make-up.
"I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?"
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
You need money again?
Yeah.
Got in a little accident.
What happened to your face?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
"Eh, if the bootie fits..."
The hell you call me?
"Alright. How much you need, ho?"
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Thought you had a man for that.
You got any money?
"Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket..."
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
"... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him."
I don't think he'd feel it.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Maybe we should bail?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Getting very weird.
I hope not.
This the right place?
You said that in the last two places.
This should be it...
First decent idea you've had.
Let's grab some food.
"... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side."
"I said let's go, Charlie."
"Nick, we can't just --"
Let's go.
"In Rome, I'll bow."
"Hey, when in Rome --"
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
I didn't know.
"I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie."
"You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things."
"Go to sleep, Charlie."
Number five with a bullet.
"Nick, have I been a good partner?"
No.
Nick... You up?
"Where is the subway station, please."
What'd you say?
Not a prayer.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
"I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas."
"... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere."
Saving your life.
What are you doing?
"Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm."
Maybe we should do something?
Some party.
The Wolf?
Frank Abolofia.
What?
"Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?"
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Who do you think the Jap is?
"Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked."
What are they doing now?
-- I should tear your head off.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Charlie...
"Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello."
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Why?
Get rid of it.
Back-up.
Let go...
What's this?
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Home.
"Hey, hey, where you goin'?"
Thanks.
"Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs."
"You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'"
"I think she got to you, pappy."
"Hey, all right."
What does Charlie mean?
"What does Ichiro mean, anyway?"
You all right?  You okay?
Cool?
"You cool, Ich?"
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
What'd she say?
Joyce can be nice.
"Pussy, ass, soft personnel."
Squid?
I wasn't expecting you.
Are you expecting anyone?
If you give me one.
"Give me a break, would you?"
You'll take care of that.
"High spirits, desire, commitment."
"All right, how's the new partner?"
Connie...
"It's getting too cold even for me, Nick."
"Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug."
Short shift?
How can you be so sure?
We can't lose.
"Think we'll get him, Nick?"
"Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?"
"Louder, pal, louder."
Call for help.
Yes...
You all right?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Why's that?
"You know, Nick, we can't lose."
Luck.
What's that for?
Me too.
I'm sorry.
A wife.  She left.
Thank you.  You have one?
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Someone attacked him.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
I don't know.
Joyce?
I couldn't tell.
How many men?
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
"I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting."
"You did great, Ichiro."
Kampai.
"Just one, compadre... Kampai."
I can't...
Start it.
"Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me."
No.
"Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside."
It's done.  You don't have to come.
"Nick, you can't do this."
Let's go.  Him first.
No...
So I bring some cheese?
What's in the box?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
"It's illegal, Nick."
Big enough.
It's very small.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
What...?  Why?
I want to go talk to him.
"A resort city, Beppu."
Where does this Sugai live?
"A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him."
Nick!
San is an honorable title.
"Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick."
"Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san."
I want to yank Kobo.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Shut-up.
Nick --
"We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto."
I'm not drunk...
You can trust me.
"If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --"
I'll check it out.
Gaiijin.
You can't come in.  They don't want --
You were too far behind.
She disappeared... shit!
Good.  Very good...
Yakuza.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
"Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --"
Ichiro --
"Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --"
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
"Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous..."
"If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside."
Nick...
Sure.
"You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?"
Are we getting married?
"You toler -- yes, tolerate me."
Did I say that?
There she is!
What'd I tell you?
Nick...
"No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!"
"You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'"
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
What's he saying?
A snitch?
Know her?
I stole them.
How'd you get this?
I can see that.
I've continued working on the case!
"I'll get him for you, Nick."
Yeah...
You must leave?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Why weren't you at the platform?
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
What happened?
"I don't, that's all."
Why the hell not?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
"You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever."
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Give us a break...
Nick!
What's the problem here?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
"No, this is the place for the young Yakuza."
"""Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.""  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis."
"Where're you going, Ichiro?"
Where would you look for the mafia?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
I'd like that.
"Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out."
Might be different in New York.
Can't make you change your mind?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
What if I chant?
I still think you're a bastard.
Why would you care?
No one's keeping him here.
You'll get Ich killed.
The cheese...
We're in?
Tell them I'm not.
Who am I supposed to be?
They want your autograph.
I don't remember you saying no.
I don't remember saying yes.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
What do you chant?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
You met her.
Where's the wife?
He's got a reason.
He drinks.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
You could fake it.
And I'm supposed to care?
"My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in."
I need someone to translate for me.
Unavailable.
Where's Ich?
"I need your help, Joyce."
"Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice."
I paid for that.
He's on duty.
Don't be an ass.
"Sure, but then I just pull out the photos."
She ever pull down her shades?
I don't think so.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
You have a helluva way of answering.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
I don't give tours.
"An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you."
Gaiijin?
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
There was a change in plans.
Ich said you left.
He gets as much as he wants.
Don't give him any more.
Then take it from him.
"Sugai won't give it to me, you know that."
Don't be.
I'm amused.
This is my stop.
"Time, I've got plenty of."
She's such a long way home for you.
Guess I'm on a roll.
"I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky."
"Save it, I already took the tour."
I'm taking you back.
Keep the change.
Right.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
He killed a police officer.
"I planned on catching him, Captain."
He was my partner.
It's not your job.
Why me?
What...?  What if I say no?
"You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight."
What?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Why?
"Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective."
Yeah.
One guy do all the damage?
Not in that company.
Dope?
This by this...
How big a package we talking about?
"Goodbye, officer."
I have to get to Sugai.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
"You had my help, detective."
"For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!"
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
"Twenty-four hours, detective."
"Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!"
Look.
What's this?
"Can we skip the poetry, inspector?"
"The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here."
Because I want you to tell me.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Could you fill me in?
Do you know what this is?
"Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this."
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
You're foreigners.
We're police officers.
It is not allowed.
I want a gun.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
You want him dead too.
That wasn't our deal.
Good.
I don't have to.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
If I say no?
With these?
I'll pay you.
You trust me?
Why tell me this?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
The families who control the casinos?
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
He'll be dealt with.
I want him.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Then go get him.
One man.  He must be good.
"You underestimate the trap, Mary."
Not to be trapped.
What's the point?
Anywhere.
Where?
Let's go while there is still time.
Pris?
"I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?"
If he won't cooperate?
He knows what he's doing.
Well stocked.
You certainly have a nice place here.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
"Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along..."
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Also extraordinary things.
I've done some questionable things.
I am?
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
But not to last.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Why?
Come here.
"I want more life, fucker."
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Death.
What's the problem?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Would you like to be modified?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
And what can he do for you?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
"Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you."
Oh?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
"No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together."
Just thought I'd...
"Where are you going, Sebastian?"
Thank you.
You're our best and only friend.
This afternoon.
When do you deliver your project?
No.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
His company made us.
He could?
"Tyrell could help us, Sebastian."
Dr. Tyrell?
"What about your friend, the man who owns this building?"
"If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live."
You could help us.
Of course not.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
We have a lot in common.
Like...
Like what?
Show me something?
Nexus - 6.
What generation are you?
You're androids.
"What, Sebastian?"
You're just all so... so different.
Why are you staring at us?
"Well, actually"
"Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to."
"How about breakfast, I was just going to make some."
"Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece."
I want to do it.
"Very good, Pris.  Now show him why."
"I think, therefore I am."
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
"Hello, glad to meet you."
"This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian."
"Tomorrow, he says."
When?
He's not ready yet.
What's going on down there?
Go.
Yeah.  I got it.
Got it.
"Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South."
Who.
She's not with you?
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin."
You didn't like her!?
I didn't like her.
She was gonna get away.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Garbage man?
Industrial refuse.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Where do we start?
You got a machine on it yet?
What was he after?
"Six, huh?"
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Day after tomorrow.
When might that be?
Soon as I finish the job.
"Well, when do you get paid?"
"Your customer, eh?"
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Number three.
Next.
"Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females."
Longevity is classified.  No.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
The umbrella.
And what in your estimation works?
Not if it works.
Do you have something against science?
Yes?
I think we're through for the night.
What about a summary then.
I know all that.
"Okay, but..."
How do I stop one?
You start.
"Why, yes, of course."
You equipped for random questions?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Four years.
"My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?"
I don't know.
How old am I?
I gotta piss.
"One more, eh?"
I like you too.
I like you.
No thanks.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Prosit.
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
How long you had these guys?
Ya.
Those cockroaches?
No problem.
"Sorry, don't have the time."
You want to see my friends?
Prosit.
Prosit.
My pleasure.
Thank you very much.
"Shot of vodka, please."
Vodka!
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
But I would like to buy you drink.
It's okay.  Forget it.
I think I have no money.
These aren't just...
I'm taking a piss.
What's that?
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Let's hear it.
No.  I got a problem.
Money?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm doing okay.
"Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?"
Sorry.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
"Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled."
Me too.
My job is here.
But if you could?
Too old.
Why didn't you go?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
You sure?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
What if you change your mind?
You're going to be over the limit.
Nope.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
True.
"Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy."
Huh huh.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Yeah?
During the road test...
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Meaning?
No rust?
Nerves of steel.
What shows?
"Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties."
Book the good ones for where?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
What's suck night?
What night?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Who?
What did she want?
Do you recognize any of them?
Of course.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Can I come in?
Yes?
Taffey Lewis?
And who do I go to about you?
Me.
I bet I would.
"Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?"
Sorry.
Jeezus!
Come on.
Does it eat?
The best.
You mean the snake.
It's a good job.
It that mother real?
For holes.
What the fuck for?
Are you for real?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
I don't know nothing about it.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Yeah?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
What?
You know what I think?
Just wait here.
What difference will it make?
"Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone."
"No, I don't."
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Because it's not.
"Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?"
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Ten years.
What's a long time?
Uh-huh.
You mean a woman?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
I never felt better.
"You're sick, Deckard."
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
This feels stupid.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
But then how can you...
"Never mind the plug, just go through the motions."
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
They could clean around the arrangement.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Hmmm?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Like?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
What?
"It wasn't very good last night, was it?"
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
That's another thing I can't do.
Yeah.
Did you cry when your father died?
I wish I could.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Do you dream?
"If they are smart, they take naps."
What do people do in the afternoon?
Not too good.
How are you doing?
How come you're not on the job?
Oh.
Dead.
Where is he?
Me and my dad.
Who is this?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
You did?
I told you I'd come back.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Sit.
What do you want me to do?
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Right.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Can you?  I couldn't.
I can imagine.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Do I make you nervous?
"So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me."
So?
"You use your equipment, don't you?"
I work alone.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
"Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no."
I think you need more help than you've got.
I've already got more help than I need.
"I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help."
Is there anything else?
Ugh.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
It would be my child.
In your opinion.
"That would be murder, Mr. Deckard."
Why not?
I'd never get an abortion.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
I'd kill it.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I'd take him to the doctor.
Why should I be?
Are you apprehensive?
Of course not.
It's artificial?
I'll see you in a minute.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Bad?
Holden got hit.
What's up?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Where the hell you been?
Discreetly.
"Five, maybe six."
"How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?"
She didn't know?
Thirteen.
How many questions did it take?
The machine works.  She is.
"If she is, the machine works."
Well?
Sitting next to you.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
"Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof."
But in your profession that is a risk.
No.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Go ahead.
May I ask a personal question?
Yes.
Is this to be an empathy test?
Please.
Black?
Thanks.
Almost through.
I'm tired of this.
How do you know I'm not?
Sorry.
"Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard."
"I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?"
"Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?"
"You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon."
But I understand what you mean.
I never seen a turtle.
Same thing.
Of course.
Know what a turtle is?
A tortoise.  What's that?
But how come I'd be there?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
What desert?
What?
What one?
Sorry.
Don't move.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You're all so perfect.
What makes you think so?
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Good.
"Ah, you get hold of your friends?"
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Is that why you're still here?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
What's that?
Methuselah Syndrome.
What's your problem?
Twenty.
"Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now..."
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Thanks.
Beautiful.
Just better.
You look... better.
You scared me.
Whatcha doin'?
I was hoping you'd say that.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
"I'm hungry, J.F."
We sure did.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
"I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying."
What about friends?
They left.
Where are your folks?
Oh.
I don't have one.
You want to go home?
Hi.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Pris.
What's your name?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
How come you were in my truck?
Sure.
Your mom was a dancer?
"No, I'm not! My mom taught me."
You're kidding!
Really?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
He's really funny!
I'm Adam Webber.
This is my new friend...
Thank-Q!
Bravo!
You like it?
"Oh, now, that's a great one!"
Yes?
Hi!
"Young man, stop right there!"
"Yes, ma'am."
"Let's go talk first, Adam."
"Well, that depends..."
For how long?
My office.
Come where?
"Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown."
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
How do you do?
"I'm Nina Aron, Adam."
Eve? I'm leaving.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Do ya?
"Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself."
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
What?!
"Oh, brother..."
Please excuse this interruption.
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
"Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--"
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
"I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?"
How do you do?
My mother's like that.
No.
...I do.
"...All right, Eve.  If you say so."
"Hi, Adam.  This is, uh...."
"Hi, Eve!"
Neat. Goodnight!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Really?  Okay!
It was at least as good as the sky.
My pleasure.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
"Yes, Eve?"
Uh-huh. Adam?
No.
"Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?"
Sing it to me.
Is that what you call it?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Thanks.
There.
"Well, you had better!!"
I know first aid!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
"Eve, if you'll let me, I can --"
Goodnight!
What?
"Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!"
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry!
"Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!"
Eve?!
"But, Eve, I would--"
"I'm leaving, too."
"Eve, I'm sorry."
I don't blame you!
I'm sorry.
Adam?!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You wanted to see me!
Did you?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
What?
"Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be."
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
That's ridiculous.
Really?
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
"Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it."
Okay. I like that.
How 'bout this one?
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
No way.
What about her?
"It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told."
What have you ordered?
And don't be so obvious!
I like her.
Not that one!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Good-bye!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Yes!
Do I look crazy?
No!  Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
No it's not!
I certainly do!
"Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?"
"Hey, Eve!"
Okay!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
"Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo."
Yeah.
About clothing?
That's boring!
The guy with the underpants!
"Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?"
The what?
"So, what are you seeing?"
All right.
Uh...yeah.
May I please be excused?
In the house?
Sure.
He has a computer?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Where's he gone?
Good for you.
Wow.
Yes!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Um-hum.
"Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?"
"Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!"
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Thank-Q!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
What?!
"Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants."
I like it.
Yes!
Is this your house?
I was wrong!!
You said it would be easy!
Never drive again!
I told you I've never driven before!
You almost got us killed!
Sorry!
Stop that ma'am crap!
"Yes, ma'am!"
"Now, get out!!"
The engine is still running.
Get out!
Thank you.
Of course.
Could we talk about that a little later?
That's what I was afraid of.
Two weeks.
When do you need her by?
"And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena."
"No dogs, huh? Okay."
One who's not a mutant.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
It didn't used to be that way.
Everybody's divorced.
They're all divorced?
I didn't know that.
Sure.
It does?
The big one!
Bites what?
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
I don't want to be alone.
Why?!
Because I want to get married.
What for?
Yes.
A wife?
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
This is for me.
"No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?"
Then forget it.
"Oh, I'm sure it will!"
"Well, this is going to sound a little crazy."
Name it.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
"Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat."
Okay.
"And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh..."
Thank you.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
I guess we'll need another locker.
"It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy."
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Night!
"Hey, you know. I was thinking..."
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Sorry.
"Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!"
What?
Wait! Wait!
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
"Very funny, smart ass."
My Mom and Dad.
Who are these people?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Sure.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's fair?
What's the pay?
Two weeks.
How long would you need me?
"Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help."
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Doing what?
Why not go to work for me?
...Okay.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
What?
Why doesn't it never work out?
"See, ya."
Cross my heart and hope to die.
"Hey, no kidding?  In color?"
Watching television in color.
I think it's the eyes.
Thank-Q!
No.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Okay!  Damn!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
"Wait, Eve, please!  Wait."
"Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit."
I haven't brushed yet.
Why are you doing that?
Okay.
Take it. damn it!
"I can't, it's yours."
Right.
"Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase."
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
I know a short-cut.
"Hey, what are you doing?!"
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Over this?
"Oh, I could die..."
How's that?
"Okay, okay!  Take it easy!"
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Perry?
It's Perry!
What is it?!
Wait!  Wait!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
"So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?"
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
"Heck, no!  What?!"
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Get away from me!!
"I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!"
"Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!"
Nope.
You don't?
"If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun."
Do you own a car?
"Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on."
It was amazing.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Again.
Right.
"Yes, I'm right?"
So far?
"Oh, that's nice."
"Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing."
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I came on a bus.
"Here, pick these up!"
I just had a mental picture of...
What's wrong with you?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Dickhead?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
"Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?"
You're lost?
"No, I'm lost."
Where are we going?
"Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam."
"Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner."
"No, you get out of here."
Get out of here!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Are you French?
"Bon soir, mademoiselle!"
Of course!
"Yes, sir."
A card?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Nothing.
What?
Is this because of the radiation?
Gee-ma-nee!
"Yes, it is."
Is that a birthday cake?!
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
I promise.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
How do I leave here?
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
"I've got to go, now."
Yes.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Are you all right?
"Uh, I think they have."
Uh-huh.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
"What? Did the politburo just one day say - ""We give up?"""
"Yes, sir. It's true."
That's what everybody believes?
You're sure?
Uh-huh.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
"Well, in that case...of course, son."
"And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why."
"But, I don't understand."
I'll try.
I promise. Is that all?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
"Also...stay out of the ""Adult Bookstore."""
"Yes, sir.  Is that all?"
...the pipe tobacco.
"Yes, father?! Yes?"
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Merci!
"C'est bon, Monsieur."
Shit is a French word?
"Well, do we just go on up?!"
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
No kidding!
Your mom made that all by herself.
"Oh, boy! A jacket!"
Blow out the candles!
"Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!"
Because he must!
Then why go there?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Why?
"No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!"
No. Sit down.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Like one of Mom's?
"No, son. A pitcher."
Like a painting?
"It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher."
What's baseball?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
These are wonderful.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

Tempus fugit!
"You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!"
"Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday."
"Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam."
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
What?
And thanks for always being happy!
"Bye, Adam!"
"Bye, Troy!"
Goodbye.
"Good-bye, Adam."
Yeah...Seems to.
Does that work?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
What?
"So, did you buy a movie?"
You bet!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
"Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!"
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
"Okay. Thank you, my friends."
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
"Ladies first, Troy! That was close."
What?!
Oh. I see.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Why did you park way back there?
I LOVE THIS!!
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
"The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months."
The recovery is very impressive.
Almost all of them.
No.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Okay.
I just don't want to.
Why not? He has great pants.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Not on him.
True.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
"Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?"
Yes. He likes windows.
"He's a Windows guy then, huh?"
"Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him."
Yeah?
That would knock my father out.
"Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!"
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
No.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
It's so small.
Yeah.
This must be very new.
"Sorry, that's the largest city."
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Juneau.
What's the capitol?
When did we get it from them?
Russia.
Who use to own it?
1959.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
She's right?!
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
That's right?
"Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town."
Right on the button.
Really?  Since when?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
And it's called...?
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
You nut!
I love Lucy!
Not particularly.
"I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?"
You have very nice ceilings.
Goodnight.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Twenty-five? Around there.
How old do I look?
You don't look thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
How old are you?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
My father is a genius.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
"I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice."
The hotel.
Of what?
You dial nine to get out.
Just look!!
I don't see anything!
Up there!!
The sky?  Where?
The sky!!!
What?  What is it?!
Gladly.
Sure.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
"Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box."
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
"Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties."
Help you?
Good!
I do alright.
"How do you do, ma'am."
Say what?!
"Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!"
Whatcha looking at?
"Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?"
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
"Oh, you got a problem with that?"
"Well, we're here to help!"
"Oh, that would be wonderful!"
Really? No kidding?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
"How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?"
Hi.
Hello.
Yes.
No.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
"Well, where are you --"
"No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office."
This is your bedroom?
"No, wait! At least stay for dinner!"
We have to go.
What?
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
A psychiatrist?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
"Are you in trouble, son?!"
"Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents."
"Yes, ma'am."
"Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything."
"Yes, ma'am."
Yes?
Mom?
I just hope this is still good up there.
Right.
"Yes, ma'am."
You're my brave boy.
I'll be all right.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll go up.
"Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom."
Dad!
"Sorry, Mom!"
"Elbows, Son."
"Yes, ma'am."
"Oh. A nice one, I hope."
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
"Oh, my God!"
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
He drank it hot?
All back East.
What about relatives?
"Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess."
"No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to..."
Really?
"Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?"
"So...you...survived the blast, did you?"
Good.
"What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!"
"You got a light, honey?"
"What can I offer you, Eve?"
Some time.
"Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um..."
I thought ten years.
How long will you set it for this time?
Amen.
"Yes, dear, I know."
He's smart.
--do as I say!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--and we will--
I want him to at least see the sky!
"Well, I am the head of this household--"
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
Yes.
We do?
We stay down here.
"Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?"
I don't believe it!
Yes.
No.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
Mutants?!
Yes! That's right!
"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
"Yes, yes it is!"
Just open the door.
Should we say a little prayer first?
"I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?"
"Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work."
In the generator room again?
Sure.
Would you excuse me?
Yes...
If we still have one.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Let's eat our cake.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
"Well, we did in my family!"
"If he tells, it won't come true!"
"What did you wish for, Adam?"
And I made these!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
You bet.
Get the presents and do the lights.
Coming!
Calvin!
Hi.
"Hi, honey!"
What?
Watch this!
Yes.  Well... yes.
"Very nice. Unless it caved in, too."
Why?
"Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway."
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Right here!
Calvin?!
"What? Whatever you want, Helen!"
If I...you know...
Yes!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No.  I think it's just right.
What shall we call him?
I've noticed.
"No, Calvin.  Babies cry."
Is there a problem?
Honey?
"Uh, oh. Now it's time."
What?
"Oh, no."
I told you! I've got everything!
You have tranquilizers?
Would you like a tranquilizer?
"No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!"
How could you?! This is just like home!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Really?
"No, Calvin, you're favorite."
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
I'm not hungry.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
All our friends...
"We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child."
No.
"Hi, honey! Feeling better?"
To go up.
To go up.
It's safe.
Then after that it's safe.
Thirty -five years!
The locks?
The locks.
What's that noise?
To you maybe.
Home sweet home!
As long as we've got that straight.
"Yes, dear!"
"But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time."
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Days??
"I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days."
How long will we have to stay down here?
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Yes.
You hear that?!
I never know anymore.
No.  They all do.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
It shuts off automatically.
"Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--"
It's time.
"You bet, hon!"
"Well, put it down and come in!"
"Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat."
"For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!"
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
"Stop it, you two!"
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
"Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel."
"So where is your roommate, the model?"
"Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be."
"This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff."
"Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?"
You came back for these?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I forgot some of my stuff.
What are you doing here?
What are you bitching about now?
Stop!
Where?!
Adam!!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
"Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home."
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Come on.
What?!
"No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store."
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
We came back to the house!
Then what?
To get some frozen poultry.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Yeah! That's thinking.
Have him committed.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
What's wrong?
We'll find him.
And if we can't find him?
Give it back to him.
What do you want to do with it?
Fallout shelter.
"Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?"
"Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!"
Gay.
What?!
"Oh, no!"
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Coward!
I don't think so.
You're goddamn right I am!
"Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!"
What?!!
He left with Sophie.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He didn't leave with them.
Where did he get all that information?
"Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is."
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
What?
Or have perfect table manners.
"Yes, you do!"
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
"Uh, yes, you do."
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
"Yes, you do."
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
To bed?
To bed.
Where are you going?
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Those sluts!
"Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me."
"I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?"
What's it to you?!
Who did he leave with?
We did not leave together.
What's that mean?
Uh..he might of.
He go back to the hotel?
"Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!"
Go to the bathroom.
Um... Eve?
"Adam,  I think for you, we should go for ""sweet."""
"Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal."
Eve?!
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Always good advice.
Just be yourself.
He's from Alaska.
That water's freezing!
No.
"How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?"
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
I think...it...works.
"Well, what do you think?"
"What do you think, Adam?"
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
"Alright, I will."
That's what I'm sensing.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
"I see ""elegant."""
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
"Well, that's blunt!"
What's that supposed to mean?
"You're serious, aren't you?"
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
I don't know.
"But first, you have to start with the clothes!"
"Oh, my God..."
Give me your hand.
"I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?"
"Oh, yes."
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
"So, Adam...where on earth are you from?"
I knew you'd like him.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
"Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!"
Buy it from me?
"Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh..."
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Um...uh...
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
"You bet, Mom! Coming up!"
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
"Roger, Wolf One."
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
"Tower, say again!!"
"Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?"
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Stand by. One.
"Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?"
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
"Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it."
Okay honey.
I've seen a few.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I'm not sick.
"Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?"
"No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry."
"Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?"
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Yeah. How's Dad?
"You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?"
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
"See you Tuesday, Frank."

Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
"Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer."
Frank. Come in.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Not yet.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
"Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?"
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes sir.
Yes sir. I sure am.
You're all through with this now?
Only you and the photo lab.
Who knows you have these?
"No, not at all."
Is Sandy part of this?
"Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?"
Okay?
Yeah.
"Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift."
Jeffrey! Come on in.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
What color is it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
What is this? What color is it?
Yeah. I get it.
Why do you do it?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
The criminals are winning.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
"If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures."
Yes?
Jeffrey?
It must be great.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
"Excuse me, Mrs. Williams."
Come into the study a minute.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
"Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it."
You did? A human ear?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yes.
Are you Detective Williams?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
"I promise, Dorothy. I promise."
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Don? Where is he?
"Hold me, Don."
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
"Who, Dorothy?"
They hurt his head.
My secret lover.
It's okay. It's okay.
"Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God."
"Yeah, it's me."
No.  Hi baby.
Oh no.
You look beautiful to me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
What?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'll call you.
I think I better go.
I want you to stay with me.
I guess I should go.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Yes.
I did. Are you?
You called me Jeffrey.
Dorothy. No!
I'm glad you do.
"There's no disease, I can tell you."
You what?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"No, it's not Don."
I love you Don with all my heart.
Just get outta my bed.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
"And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!"
Sometimes I think I do.
I asked first.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Kiss me.
"Look, snap out of it, will ya?"
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Come on Dorothy.
Beeeee careful.
Shut up.
Does that scare you?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Frank would open you.
"That wouldn't be too good, would it?"
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Yes.
"You like to open me, don't you?"
No police!!!  No police!!
I want you to hurt me.
What do you want?
"Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything."
Whatiya mean?
Are you a bad boy?
I'm doing it.
What do you want to do?
Sure I do.
Do you like my body?
That's good.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I sure don't hate you.
Frank is coming?
Yes. Frank--
"I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy."
"It used to make me laugh, but."
Hello.
Come in.
"Please, please stay."
No. I should go.
Yes.
"Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?"
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Don? Are you in with them?
Who is Don?
"No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?"
Falling.
No.
Look.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
"Who's it, you mean."
Nice guy. Who's he?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Oh shit.
Same here.
I liked being with you last night.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
"I, uh."
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
"Yeah, hurry up though."
"Hi, can I come in?"
OK.
Don't say that.
Then don't talk about killing.
No. What is happening?
You don't?
No.
Do you know?
What?
I made it go down the toilet.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
"Yes, I like you."
Do you like me?
"No, please. I won't."
"You can hit me, if you want to."
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes.
See my breasts? See?
Yes.
Do you like the way I feel?
It's okay. It's okay.
Thank you. honey.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
No.
Don?
I'll go then.
Sure I'm alright.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
No.
Do you like talk like that?
Yes.
Do you like that?
What do you want?
"I, I don't know."
What do you want from me?
No way.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
"NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you."
No. Come on.
Never before this.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Then you got undressed.
THEN WHAT?
Well.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
"I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed."
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
"An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before."
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Nobody.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I wanted to see you.
Jeffrey nothing.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey.
Yeah.
That oughta do it.
"Oh yeah, that's good."
"Nope, it's new stuff. No smell."
"Oh God, that stuff stinks."
"Pest control, gotta do your apartment."
Yes? What is it?
"Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you."
"Oh he forced you, huh?"
"'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight."
He's comin' back? What for?
"Alright, suit yourself."
Bull.
"Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back."
Frank gone?
"Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty."
If you want to.
Can I feel 'em?
Those are my breasts.
"Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?"
"Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please."
Look at these. What are these?
"Then, shut up!"
"Yes, but."
"You want to see him too, right?"
Frank?
"Where are we going, Frank?"
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Who's this fuck?
Baby wants to fuck.
Mommy's here.
MOMMY!
My bourbon.
"Hello, daddy."
"Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head."
"Hello, baby."
"Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?"
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
"I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!"
Yes.
Nothing.
What are you lookin' at?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
What?
Hey? You like to walk.
"Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please."
Here's to Ben.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

"A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go."
On a ride.

No thanks. What does that mean?
No thanks.
Speak to me Fucker.
Hello?
"Good, let's drink up."

"No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer."
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What kinda beer do you like?
Okay Frank.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
"God, you scared me."
"Of course, Jeffrey."
Can I use the car tonight?
Alright.
"No, I'm just gonna walk around."
Do you want the car?
I'm going out for awhile.
"Thanks a lot, Mom."
What?
Yeah?
"Jeffrey, when you see your father."
Well. Okay.
What time are visiting hours?
Be right down.
"Jeffrey, breakfast is ready."
This is it.
"Where's all your things, Jeffrey?"
Mom.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
"I mean, for good, Jeffrey."
I'll get a coat for her.
"Sandy?... Sandy, please."
"Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes."
"Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute."
That sounds great!
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
"Say ""goodnight"" to Sandy."
"Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey."
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Yeah.
He comes over to study.
Yeah. okay.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
No. No thank you.
Would you like a piece of cake?
"Yeah, I know."
Alright.
"Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?"
"Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?"
"Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!"
"Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much."
"I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered."
"No, you're right."
Well.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
No.
Good deal Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
How ya doin' Dad?
"It's good to see you, Dad."
"Good to see you, son."
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Hey Jeff.
Hi Dad.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Look Jeffrey.
"Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me."
No Jeffrey!!
Go ahead!
Sandy?
Go ahead.
"I should go with her, Sandy."
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
"Right. Watch out for Mike, there."
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Probably not. No. Why?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Yes.
Dorothy Vallens?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
"Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you."
No.
My father has a gun at home.
Frank!!!
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Okay.
You want to dance?
Just a minute.
Let's wait for some slow one.
NO.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Really?
I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?
"I like that idea, that's a real good idea."
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You look beautiful.
It's okay.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Where to?
It's good to see you.
"Nothing, really! It's good to see you."
What was that all about?
Just some fatherly advice.
What is it?
Okay.
Okay. Great!
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
No.
You didn't tell him about me?
Everything okay?
You worry about me really?
"Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much."
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah.
Jeffrey!!
Oh yeah?
Shoot.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
"You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals."
You want to go talk to him?
What am I going to do?
I'm really sorry.
You were late.
See ya tomorrow.
Goodnight.
"Okay, okay."
"You better not, Jeffrey."
Can I give you a kiss good night?
"Okay, Sandy."
"Okay, be careful."
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
That's what I thought.
"Who, me? Why should it?"
"That doesn't bother you, does it?"
Yeah?
"Yeah. I mean a little, you know."
Did you see her undressed?
Yes.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Actually. I've been in twice.
You saw a lot in one night.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to tell me about it?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
You want a Dairy Queen?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
"I'm sorry, I didn't..."
He got a little jealous.
What's with Mike?
"Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?"
What did you see?
"Well, how did it go? What happened?"
"Okay, okay. Bye."
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
"Okay, thanks."
Are you sure?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Yeah.
"Look, it can wait till Sunday."
"Okay, yeah, call."
"Oh, okay, can I call?"
"I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over."
"Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit."
OK.
"Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?"
"Yeah, but."
"It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you."
Why not?
"Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it."
I'll drink to that.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Two.
That sounds good.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Brilliant.
What's the plan.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."
"You really want to do this, don't you?"
Yes. I do.
"I owe you, since I goofed up this one."
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
"So, what's next?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, if it opens the door."
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
"Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?"
Are you alright?
"Alright. Good luck, yourself."
"Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner."
"Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?"
Let's go.
Alright.
You've got a point there.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
"Now, how are you going to do that?"
"It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess."
"Alright, now tell me. What is it?"
"Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart."
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
"I'm here, aren't I?"
I don't want to cause any trouble.
"Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute."
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't know.
"You hungry or thirsty, or both?"
Yeah. Good bye.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I've gotta go in.
I don't know. He moved away.
What happened to him?
"Still, it must be kinda rough."
"You really do hear a lot, don't you?"
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
"I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case."
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Where are they?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Maybe so.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
"Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?"
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
That's too bad.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
What else is new? Right?
Terrible boring.
How is Central these days?
Yes.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Am I bothering you?
"Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something."
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Oh yeah?
"I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central."
"Yeah, how did you know?"
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Stop it Mike.
Okay.
"Come on out a minute, okay?"
"Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me."
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
You can change it if you want to.
What are watchin' this junk for?
"Yeah, nice meetin' you."
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Oh fuck!
Up where?
Just for him?
What did he bring him in for?
Go find one.
There's ways around that.
"Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here."
The Duke?  What did you do?
I need Il Duce.
"Hey, I just..."
Fuck you.
Aye.
Are ya ready?
Yes mother.
"What did you do, Connor?"
"Mother Mary, full of grace."
Lord's name.
What?
"Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem."
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Got it.
Look under the body.
"I can't find the second one, sir."
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Yes sir.
You gotta keep going.
We're here brother.
You guys?
"You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man."
"Let him go or I will deliver you, right now."
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
They got nothing.
"What?  What, that guy?"
Shit.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Look again for fuck sake!
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
"Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!"
C'mon!
"You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit."
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
What? What is it?
I-I'll tip her.
What the fuck are you doing?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
"Yeah, well..."
Anybody see ya?
"Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!"
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
"I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!"
What happened?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
"No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled."
You think they sold me out? No way.
"Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets."
What are you saying?
What?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
You sound real remorseful.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
"Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco."
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Yes.
Anybody you think is evil?
"Get a hold of yourself, man."
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Let's do him right here.
This is a six-shooter.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Where's your gun?
"All right, I suppose you have the right ta know."
"Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?"
"Still bickerin' over that, huh?"
"Yeah, we promise."
"Well, I didn't but..."
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
BLAME...
No ma! No!
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What?! What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
"I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor."
"Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here."
"Ma, what's wrong?"
"Mother, is that you?"
"Connor, is that you?"
Hello.
"I'll call you tonight, afterwards."
Be careful.
Our mother can see through bags.
Know any other languages?
We paid attention in school.
"So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?"
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
We... met them last night.
Ass!
me up the...
Fuck!
Would someone please come over here and...
Right.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
What are you going to do?
We're alive.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
"It is your evil, who will be sought by us."
It is your corrupt we claim.
We do not want your tired and sick.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
"Now, you will receive us."
He's a good man.
He isn't to be touched.
And he is one smart man.
"That's the guy that got us off the hook with the ""Checkov"" thing."
A-fuckin'-men!
Give the guy a shot.
"So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?"
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So what do you think?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Who did you kill?
Then what the fuck?
Yes.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
"Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it."
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Nine bodies.
"Yes, we are."
"Oh, we're good man."
"Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes."
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Aye.
That was way easier than I thought.
"Sh, sh! Fuck you!"
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
"We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole."
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Where the fuck are you going?
Just like on TV.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
"Me, too."
A bit.
Nervous?
"All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope."
"Is that right, Rambo?"
"What is all this ""they"" shit? This ain't a movie."
I don't know they just always need it.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I'm serious.
"Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?"
What?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
For what?
"Know what we need, man?... some rope."
...so that which is good may flourish
Destroy all that which is evil...
"No pictures, either."
Absolutely not.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Italian.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
"""I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."""
"""Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"""
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Okay. We're ready.
"""What do we tell him about the guns and money?"""
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
He got beat up by a girl.
"Don't even do it, ya bastard."
"Oh, Jesus."
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!"
Shut it. It's Ma.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
How many?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aye.
Hey Murphy?
Aye.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
"Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax."
"Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?"
Yeah?
Rule of thumb?
Okay then... let's get ya started.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
"Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends."
How do you figure?
"The shooter knew these guys, huh?"
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
"Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?"
Three.
Of course they were. How many?
They were wearing masks.
Can she I.D. them?
She was in here when it went down.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
"So, what do we do now?"
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Uh... two shooters!
"And number three, Dolly."
"Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology."
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
"Male or female, bitch?!!"
It was... It was...
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Pee...Per...Man.
"My, my..."
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
You killed my... my...
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
"You... oh god, why?"
"I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!"
Where's my cat?
What?
Rocco!
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Why was I not informed of this?
What?
No way they could have seen it?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What about one guy with two guns?
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
The Sicilians.
The Greeks. The Italians.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
And the pennies?
The fat man.
The what man?
"So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie."
Really want to know?
So what are you thinkin' here?
"Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?"
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Who were the victims?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
No way they could have seen it.
Witness?
"Uh.  Shit, I, uh..."
Shit! Shit!
"While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?"
Eight.
"How many bodies, Greenly?"
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
"He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?"
Sweet-n-low!
"Chief, what the fuck is this?"
Twist of lemon!
Who the...
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
We promise.
Promise me boys.
Just called ta torture us did ya?
"Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now."
"Oh, she's quite proud of herself."
I...
Oh my god!
What the...?
"You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever."
"We'll keep going, Roc."
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
"Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility."
You bet your ass he will.
I mean he ain't here.
What the fuck do you mean?
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
"Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!"
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
"Well, I'm sold."
"Worst day of my life, man."
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
"Well, what'ya do?"
"Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps."
So?
"Y'know it is, a bit."
Liberating isn't it?
You sure you killed them?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
"This is some crazy shit, man!"
Hurry the fuck up!
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
No. You sure you're okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Roc. You okay?
"Hey, Murph."
Hello?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
No. You sure you're okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Roc. You okay?
Hey Murph.
Hello?
I'll be back at 9:00.
"Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!"
Fuck you!
"Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!"
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
What are you serious?
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
"We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open."
"Well fuck, you guys could do this every day."
"Hallelujah, Jaffar."
Right now.
"Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen."
Forgive me father.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
No. They would never do that.
"Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?"
Yes.
You know them personally?
I believe these young men are right.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
"I want to stand for what I believe in, father."
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
You're right.
I guess not.
Has he now?
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
You believe?
God's permission? God doesn't...
What is it my son?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Y-Yes my son.
Hello? You there?
Just go!
"How long since your last confession, my son?"
"Just be natural, goddamit."
What do you want me to say?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
God have mercy on my soul.
"Father, I'll do you right here."
"That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing."
Have you no fear of God?
Open it!
Don't do this my son.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see."
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Yes.
"You gonna do what I say, got it?"
Continue the joke.
He's a nigger.
The... The funny man.
Yeah boss?
"Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here."
"Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya."
"Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?"
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
"Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy."
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Scale the --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
"Dignan, I --"
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
What?
"Dignan, I --"
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
How?
No. I'm not.
You're kidding.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
He stole a tractor.
What's he in for?
So how is it in there?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Does it float?
Behind Bob's house.
Where?
"Oh, I'd say about --"
How big is it?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
You're living on a sailboat?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
"Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?"
We're not sure.
Why?
You think Applejack knew?
The grandfather clock?
Pretty much everything.
What'd he get?
I'm not kidding.
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah.
He did?
"I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house."
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Like amnesia.
I don't think so.
"Dignan, it's too late."
"Yes, there is. Let's get organized."
There's not enough time.
I'll get him.
What are you talking about?
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
Come on.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
You're kidding.
"Come on, Kumar."
Wait for Kumar.
Let's go. Come on.
What are you doing?
"Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?"
I don't know.
Where's Kumar?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Who tripped the alarm?
Careful. Check his pulse.
Help me move him.
Get against the wall!
Nobody move!
Freeze!
Applejack! What's happening?
It's going back down.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
What's happening? What's going on?
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
I don't know.
"Stand by, Bird Dog."
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Good. It's supposed to be.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Any activity?
"I'm in position, Scarecrow."
OK. Roger.
Take your second position.
Uh-huh?
Hang on a second.
We all set?
Roger.
You're all clear.
"Go ahead, Bird Dog."
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
So do I.
Yes. I do.
Yeah. As a girl.
As a person?
Do you like Inez?
He was all right.
He was a nice guy.
"Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared."
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I don't think you will.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Did that hurt?
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Next week we'll be drinking piÒa coladas.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I did.
OK. Mark that down.
Eleven fifteen.
"I'm sorry, Bob."
"I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy."
What the fuck are we doing out here?
"Shit, Dignan."
"Easy, Dignan. It's OK."
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
"No, Dignan. This isn't --"
Get out of the way.
He doesn't want to fight.
Bob!
Dignan. Take it easy.
He seems pretty good.
What do you think?
Let me feel that.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Right now.
What time did he say to be here?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Who's Mr. Henry?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
"It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage."
What is it?
I want you to look at this.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
Sure.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's in the car?
Ah. Couple days ago.
When'd you get back?
Shut up!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
I know that. But --
That's what she is!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
She needed it.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
$383.
How much?
I had to give some to Inez.
Where's the rest?
I know.
Sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
We've got sixteen dollars.
Our money situation is not good.
I'm not. But there's --
"Don't panic, Anthony."
I think we better go home.
"No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram."
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
"Yes, I do. Bob taught me."
You don't know how to hotwire.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Shh.
"I don't know, Dignan. I just --"
She doesn't need to know.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't think we can do that.
"Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?"
What?
I have an idea for that.
We need a car.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Would of been nice.
I wish I'd been there.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
OK.
Why don't you come with us.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
"Well, the world is a little bit colder today."
If you say so.
"Well, I didn't do it, did I?"
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
He told you and you let him do it.
You were asleep.
Where was I?
This morning.
When'd he tell you?
That's a long time to be in jail.
We said 48 hours.
He went back for his brother.
Maybe he just went to the store.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Right here.
Where was it parked?
He's gone. He stole the car.
Yes... It's true.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
This was in fourth grade.
"Don't worry about it, Bob."
"See, now we've got a plan."
Bob?
Obviously. That's a given.
As long as he gets out OK.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No kidding.
She's from Cuba.
On the left.
Which one was that?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
They don't?
"No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English."
What. What's the matter?
What the fuck is going on here?
Sure.
"May I have a word with you, please?"
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
"Inez, this is --"
Hi.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
No. We didn't.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
"No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that."
"Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?"
True.
"Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up."
It's not a plan. It's just --
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
"Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony."
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
"No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know."
"Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts."
Bob?
You owe me fifty bucks.
On your marks...  Get set go.
OK. Go ahead.
I'll say it.
I'll just say it.
You were spoiled rotten.
"Don't call me spoiled, Dignan."
"Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes."
"Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those."
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
What about them?
Look at the treads on those.
"Yes, they are."
"Dignan, those aren't running shoes."
See if mine are in there.
"Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that..."
I keep it for emergencies.
"Well, then cut it in half."
I don't want to use it.
"She's not going to notice, Anthony."
Because my mom gets the bill.
Why not?
"I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan."
Can I get that credit card from you?
"Don't even say it, man."
"He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do."
What do you think?
What's wrong with him?
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Yeah.
Like he meant it.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
What about what that guy said?
We got it. We got it.
Holy shit.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Is that the manager?
We know there's another stocker.
"There's another stocker, right?"
Where's the other stocker?
Where's the manager?
You're right. You're right.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Dignan! Stop!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
"Dignan, calm down."
"No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours."
"Anthony, give me the fucking gun!"
Nothing. Go ahead.
You think we're going to be chased?
Just turn right here.
Loop around real fast.
Yeah.
Is it back in?
Hang on a second.
But he didn't say anything.
That's not bad.
Eight dollars.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
"Five, seven, eight dollars."
"Yeah, I heard that."
It had an alarm.
"No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there."
That sets it off.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
"Dignan, it's got an alarm."
I'm lookout.
"Yeah, I saw it."
Did you see that?
"That's not what I meant, Dignan."
How was I ridiculing you?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Where are you going?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
"But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?"
What do you think the cops have?
"It's got a V-8, Dignan."
She's an attractive older woman.
She's really kind of hot.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Would they do that?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
No. This is he.
This is he?
He says. This is he.
What does Starsky say?
"See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream."
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Why?
"I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony."
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
"Dignan, it's --"
OK. That's wrong.
Right. The blond guy.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
What color hair does he have?
Why'd you want to help us?
Absolutely.
"Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?"
We're renegades from despair.
It's an esoteric journey.
Yeah.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
This is good.
"Anthony, I'm petrified."
"Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?"
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
No. Bob did.
"The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?"
Death.
Exactly. Woah.
Are you afraid?
I don't want to die.
"No, that door over there."
Me?
That sounds like Dignan.
How'd he do?
"Yes, he did."
Did Dignan take the test?
It feels good.
How does that feel?
Take a deep breath.
That was a test?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
What do you mean?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Hold it.
"And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend."
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
So do I.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
You mean a safecracker?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
You mean like techniques?
Grammar.
Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Thanks.
That's a sharp jacket.
Nice to meet you.
"This is my business manager, Rowboat."
Temporarily.
It's in the driveway.
"His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account."
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Who's got the car keys?
Yeah.
I didn't do anything.
"Jesus, Bob."
No.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
What are you doing?
Sure.
Nothing. I was just asking.
"You OK, Bob?"
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Give him a second.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
It was stupid.
Let's not even talk about it.
Jesus Christ! No.
Was Future Man adopted?
No. I wasn't adopted.
"Well, because you guys don't look alike."
Why do you say that?
"Were you adopted, Bob?"
"Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell."
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Sixty days?
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
"No, I don't mind."
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You think I'm improving?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Why not?
I'm not playing any more golf.
"Bob, where you going?"
Is that OK?
What?
"Anthony, I --"
How long are they going to hold him?
He looked too shaken-up.
You think he got my license plates?
"OK, Dad."
Nobody does.
Move.
Where you going?
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I hope not.
"Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy."
There's a million places to hide around here.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
What was that?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
"See you, Bob."
See you.
Yeah. He said that.
Are you serious?
Let them fight.
Let them fight.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
"I don't know. Sure, I guess."
Could you grow cinnamon?
Hector woudn't do anything.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Did you ever steal a car before?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Who?
Future Man.
Like silk?
What?  What?
"God, yes. Like silk."
"Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?"
"Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?"
Cuba.
Were you born in Mexico?
No.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Dies y nueve.
How do you say nineteen?
Where were you?
The front stairs.
Where'd they come from?
Feel this.
What do you mean?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Abdul-Shabazz?
"Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz."
Uh-uh.
"S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?"
Uh-uh.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
I hear you're a good thief.
Yeah.
You're Anthony?
"Nice to meet you, Applejack."
Bob! Get back in position!
What?
True.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
"Well, this isn't really a party per se."
"Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac."
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Wait. Did he see us?
What's he doing here?
Yeah.
That's your friend Anthony?
That's Anthony.
Wait a second.
Is that him?
Is that Buckethead?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
The one and only Little Richard.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I don't know about that.
"Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts."
You're the faggot.
Are you a fag?
Now!
Wait a second --
Here we go.
Hold on --
"I don't really want to talk about it, Bob."
Do they let you --
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Do you have your own cell?
"We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells."
Do you have your own room?
What's that?
Run. Run. Let's go.
Applejack drove.
He's stuck between two floors.
Where's Applejack?
The elevator broke.
"Take him to the car, Bob."
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I think so.
Is he breathing?
Let's go!
He's having a heart attack or something.
What's wrong with Applejack?
I couldn't hear anything.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Everything OK?
Yeah?
Scarecrow?
Jesus Christ.
"I know it, man. Hang on."
"Come on, Bob."
Look. We want you on the job.
That's OK.
That's OK.
"I'm sorry, Bob."
I didn't have any choice.
"It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother."
"I don't want to fight you, Dignan."
Come on!
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Bullshit.
"Bob, you're lying!"
I never agreed to that.
You said 48 hours!
"Man, I don't want to go into this."
"I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?"
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Yeah. It is.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
"Not a whole lot, Bob."
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not bad.
"Hey, Dignan. How's it going?"
Anthony. Bad news.
Dignan.
Let's go.
"You've got a beautiful walk, Bob."
"It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan."
What's his name?
"Just get in the car, Bob."
What is it?
"Yes, I do."
You don't even know his name.
I know it's not.
"His name's not Future Man, Dignan."
"Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that."
"Don't threaten me, Bob."
"I can't do that, Bob."
"Give me the keys, Dignan."
"Good luck, since I got the keys."
Watch me.
Not in that car you're not.
I'm going back.
"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."
"Come on, Dignan."
This could be a trap.
"Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there."
"Bob, that makes no sense."
"Well, obviously, we got to go back."
What do you mean get back?
We'll have to see when we get back.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
I don't know.
How long has he been in there?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
That could be anybody's.
"Well, the marijuana crop is a good start."
They said he's a drug dealer.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
The weed.
What are you talking about?
My brother's in jail.
"You can go first, Bob."
See you in a little while.
Bob. Are you coming?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
What the fuck possessed you?
It's registered in my mother's name.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
I don't know.
Is he chasing us?
He wouldn't move.
"Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?"
There were more than that.
So it's my fault?
I told you they were there.
"Way to go, Bob!"
"Bob, I've got nightmares."
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't want to talk about it.
"Bob, will you please listen?"
You really think he'll remember you?
No. I was calm.
"Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!"
Don't count it.
How much is there?
"Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light."
Did we get it?
That's good. Keep it at forty.
This is natural.
"Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural."
What happened?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What are you doing?
That's too bad.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
His name was Swifty?
He electrocuted someone?
"You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year."
"Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?"
God DAMMIT.
I paid for it.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Bob.
OK.
That's your domain.
That's my responsibility.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Let's just go.
I think we might of scared her.
Maybe she turned.
Where'd she go?
"I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her."
"Well, don't blame me. I told you."
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
"No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic."
"You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild."
"I warned you, Dignan."
The guy is fucking insane.
I told you he's crazy.
What did I say?
I can't believe you said that.
What was that all about?
"Yeah, but don't tell anybody."
"You're paranoid, Bob."
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
Good question.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
"Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob."
How much could you grow? Realistically.
I'll just drive my car.
"It's true, Dignan."
"OK, Bob."
Yes. I did.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Can you use a coaster.
"What are you talking about, Bob?"
"If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one."
Let's cut the bullshit.
That never would of --
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
My brother.
So who's going to know?
They are.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
No.
Not even for emergencies?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
"I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?"
"Well, what do you think?"
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
"I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission."
"John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home."
I might have mentioned it.
"Yeah. Hey, Clay."
"Fancy seeing you here, Bob."
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I'm working on it.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
I'm trying.
You keeping out of trouble?
"Hey, Jackson. How's it going?"
"How you doing, Bob?"
Did you hear that?
Ground defense.
Hand to hand combat?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
And what does that cover?
26 weeks.
How long do you have to go?
"Well, I think --"
Why?
Yes.
We're just going over a few things.
"Join the party, fellas."
He's damn good.
Is he good?
"Oh, yeah."
"Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys."
The grammar?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
What do you mean grammar?
"I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?"
Is he in?
This is no good.
"This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry."
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What can we do?
Can't get it. It won't...
What's the story?
"He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it."
Why did he go that way?
Who? Applejack?
Where did he go?
You got that?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Where?
"Well, I left some money in there."
He left his sweater.
Where's that guy going?
"We're closed, sir."
"No, it's not."
It's locked.
Come on in!
Mr. Henry?
How's the weather down there?
Right.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
You Hoto?
No. Just pool.
Fight. You know.
What?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
She is a good looking woman.
I don't know.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Got a little lucky.
You a good pool player.
Sure.
You like Chicanos?
"She Chicano, yes?"
"No, my friend knows her."
Is that your chiquita?
No. I just have short hair.
"Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?"
Nice to meet you.
"Pleasure to meet you, John."
"Well, we'll see you later, Bob."
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
What?
"The world needs dreamers, son."
"Good to know you, John."
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Bourne comes here? Why?
What?
Save it for Bourne.
What do you mean?
"Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it."
One last push. One.
Anything else?
And the Landy woman?
Will it track back to us?
There was a mistake.
You told me Bourne was dead.
"Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is."
No. You lost your way.
No good options left?
Had to be done.
"And Danny Zorn, what was that?"
Why not? It was just money.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Sit down.
"I'm sorry, Ward."
"Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them..."
Don't know.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
"Oh, God... It must have been Bourne."
What?
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Sorry to wake you.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Don't you want answers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Berlin!
"What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!"
May I finish?
Excuse me.
Do you know what his budget was?
...this is Conklin's computer.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
And Bourne? Where's he now?
"So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap..."
I want to know what happened.
Let's talk about Conklin.
"He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward."
I want to know about Treadstone.
And what are we looking for?
That's not gonna fly.
Never heard of it.
Treadstone.
Okay...
Show me again...
"Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?"
Who else knows about this?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Lots of people...
Keep going...
Jesus...
"Is it a slam dunk? No, but..."
It was staged?
And?
"What do you have, Danny?"
The sooner the better.
She say what time I should call?
Thanks.
Sir...
I'm sorry.
Is this really happening?
I have to go now.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Because you're afraid!
I can't let you do that either.
Look at me.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
You know I'm not.
You're a liar.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I don't want you to forgive me.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
You killed them.
I killed them.
Then what?
That's not what happened to your parents.
Yes...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
What?
"No, I do."
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
Okay.
I speak English.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
-- take the back -- get another car --
-- what? --
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- car keys?
How long? How long do I have --
I'm sorry.
You called it in?
I did.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know who that is.
Pamela Landy?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Who sent you to Greece?
I don't know.
"You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?"
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Try again.
He's dead.
Conklin.
What do you want?
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
So why didn't you kill me then?
You still should've moved.
Sorry. Old habits.
Front. Use your teeth.
Drop it.
Felt a little light.
I emptied it.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
"God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you."
I only dream about people who are dead.
You do?
I know it's a dream.
It might have.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I did.
But you found another choice.
I wanted to kill him.
Tell me later.
"I love you, too."
There's no choice.
"Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this."
"I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone."
There must be another way!
"If he crosses the bridge, it is."
What if it's not who you think it is?
Where are you going?
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
-- hang on --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- it's just him? --
-- not yet --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
-- where? -
Switch! You drive!
What?
You drive.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- where's left to go? --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
We can't wait to be sure.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Where --
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
That's crazy.
So...
He was at the campground yesterday.
But you're sure?
We pushed it. We got lazy.
But we were so careful.
The Telegraph office.
No... How?
But it ends up the same.
I should be better by now.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
It's just a nightmare.
I worry when you get like this.
"I'm trying, Marie, Okay?"
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
-- it hasn't been two years --
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
No. There's nothing new.
I'll get the book.
Conklin up front.
"Where were you, Jason? In the car."
I was here!
No... Jason... please...
You never worked Berlin...
That's a lie!
Your first assignment was Geneva.
My first job.
No. You never worked Berlin.
What do you mean?
So when was I here?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Abbott?
"Why are you here, then?"
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
I killed him???
And you got to him before we could.
Last week? When?
A Russian?
Say it.
I want to hear it from you.
"What is this, a game?"
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Why is she trying to kill me?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
You hear me? I believed you.
Who is Pamela Landy?
Get on it.
Yes.
See that tram coming around the corner?
You didn't answer my question.
Sounds like a threat.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
What's that?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Are you disappointed?
Why am I alive?
Careful...
"Oh, shit..."
Where am I?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
"Okay, Jason, your move."
Who?
I want someone I know to take me in.
"Okay, how do you want to do it?"
I want to come in.
What do you want?
Bourne?
It's me.
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
What? The tapes?
You're sure?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
What?
Alright... take it down.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
-- go -- take the van! --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
"Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with."
Who's going? Us?
Looks like he's been detained.
And the Germans can't match it?
I'm working on it.
We need to get in there.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Is there. Is all there.
This is everything? Is there.
Now. Show now.
Here?
Show me.
"Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?"
Still...
"It's a lot of money, Pam."
That's where we came out.
"Yes, sir -- ma'am..."
Me? Four years.
How long have you worked for the agency?
"Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?"
Who's this?
Mr. Nevins?
Felt promising. It's a start.
So?
Let's give him half an hour.
Alright...
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Is it fresh?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
And why is that?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Some women like Dobermans --
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Did you?
"You mean, did I want a date?"
If you say so.
So he fooled you.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Believed what?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
"Am I a doctor, no, but..."
Good luck.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Amnesia?
What kind of problems?
"And what about you, anything?"
Yes. In that order.
Are we hacking or asking?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
By who?
"Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?"
Are we locked up?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Anything?
"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
"Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone."
Do we know what this says?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Someone dead from this household?
What are they doing?
"It was in Latin, sir."
"Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened."
I don't want to leave.
He has already agreed to come.
So let the council swear publicly.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
It is suicide.
We cannot defeat this --
Peace?!
We must sue for peace.
"Invade?! That's impossible, it --"
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
But... what will you do?
Longshanks promised!
He will. I know he will.
He won't come.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
"If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?"
He was a modest man.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
Does anyone know his politics?
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
"Young Robert, we are honored --"
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
But if we have not caught Wallace --
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
The Scots will fight for us?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Wallace has sacked York!
I have ordered conscriptions...
"Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word."
What news of the north?
"I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more."
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
You fancy him.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
When will his trial be?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
The little cow is insane --
Wallace's followers.
You mock us with a smile?
"Good day to you, M'Lords."
You may.
"Now, my flower, do you understand?"
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
"No, M'lord."
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
"Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!"
Scotland. He intends --
So I did! And what was so important about it?
What is it?!
No. One of us is enough.
Keep these. We're going too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
"That's just a dream, William!"
I don't want to be a martyr.
You know it's a trap.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
I rest.
"Rest, William."
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Aye.
Stephen ready?
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
"The Bruce is not coming, William."
Fourteen? --
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
"Hamish, I... thank..."
I'll wait... back there.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
Good to see you again.
I will not.
You'll move
I could crush you like a roach.
That depends on the man.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
You win.
Test of manhood.
"Aye, we'll get 'em."
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
"It's up to us, Hamish!"
"With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!"
"They're English soldiers, ain't they?"
Armed?
"Three, maybe more!"
How many?
They're coming!
"They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!"
We don't split up!
We must run in different directions!
A patriot!
A common thief.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
Let her speak.
I have faced him. Have you?
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
"Humbly, M'lord."
"...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord."
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
No. He did not.
"Shall I leave, M'lord?"
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
"Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead."
Where is my son?
I do not confess.
"It matters not, he is thy king!"
"Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --"
"Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?"
Treason. Against whom?
...Tonight!
Then when?
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Tonight then.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
I've missed you.
"I will be with you, like this. Forever."
This night is too beautiful to have again.
You scare me.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Nor I!
I'm not just saying it!
I... accept your proposal!
I want... to marry you!
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Did it work?
You've been here before?
You are. And I'll come again.
"I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy."
Thank you for inviting.
Thank you for accepting.
"Your father doesn't like me, does he?"
"Wake up, William. Wake up!"
I need you so much! I love you!
And I with you. But you must wake.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
"Yes, you are. And you must wake."
I'm dreaming.
...I wouldn't know.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
"Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for."
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
How do you know this?
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
You will die! It will be awful!
"If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already."
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
You have... you have a husband.
Why did you?
It does me good to see you.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Peace is made is such ways.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
That is not possible.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
"But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?"
"It's battle I want, not talk."
"I come as the king's servant, and with his authority."
"Wife of Edward, the king's son?"
I am the Princess of Wales.
And I will consult with mine.
I must... consult with my father.
I am trying.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
"And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?"
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
"Come, it'll help you sleep."
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Exactly.
Who would do such a thing?
"What's the crazy man saying, Lord?"
They've tricked us.
We can't stop!
"When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it."
What?
What is it?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
"No dances, just tell me."
So what did you find.
"Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago."
"Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!"
"Evan wake up, oh please wake up!"
How soon?...
You'd be surprised how often they are.
"Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple."
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
"If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related."
But you must have something to go on?
"Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now."
And the bad news?
Why? What for?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Anything.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Just. Like. Jason.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Fix?
There must be a way to fix this.
What does that mean for Evan?
"Cute, Evan."
"Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?"
"Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!"
I found these. The others are still in storage.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I don't know. These things take time.
How long will I be in here?
What? What could he do?
Sure...
Why do you ask?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
"Please, mom. People will talk."
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I... I blacked out.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Okay.
I... I don't remember.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
What happened?
Great. I'll see you soon.
"These'll bring you luck, Crockett."
"My father has a bad memory, too?"
No.
"I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?"
All the dads are gonna be there.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Can't he come out for one day?
You know the answer to that.
Um... can dad come this time?
Darn it!
"Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time."
"Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy."
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're gonna be late again.
So you believe me?
What did you see? What did it look like?
"Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess."
Weirder than this?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
"You need to see the prison shrink, man."
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Straight up.
Can you protect me?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Photos?
But I... I need those books.
My journals! Where are they?
Books?
Where are my goddamn books?
"Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour."
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
I see a car.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
"No, protecting her."
Are you hurting her?
"I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears."
Where are you now?
Yes.
"Not in this wing, actually. No."
Dad lives here?
You know my father?
"Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all."
Get out. Both of you.
"Fuck off, frat boy."
Huh?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
What?
Are you stupid or what?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What the fuck are you doing?
You really think he wanted to kill you?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Like Ozzy.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
I thought you were a December baby.
"Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday."
Then you think it might have worked out?
And...?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
I don't get it.
I was?
"Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something."
Is something the matter?
"He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck."
Stop! Take me back!
Where are we going?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Which is?
There's one major hole in your story.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Know what?
I just thought you should know.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Oh? There's proof now?
"You're right, Evan, I don't believe you."
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Yeah?
Different? How?
Because you're... different.
Why's that?
What's happened to you?
Ha! Where's that?
"Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?"
I get it. You can drop it now.
"So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor."
"Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?"
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
He's a fucking maniac!
"Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!"
What?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I walk differently?
Like how?
"It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?"
What do you mean?
Are you okay?
"Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett."
Why are you doing all this for me?
Go on. Sit down.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
You'll see.
"I don't understand, where are you taking me?"
"Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird."
So it didn't feel... weird?
"Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?"
I dunno.  Just being weird.
"Those are your clothes, silly."
Where... where are my clothes?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
"Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible."
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
"Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath."
"No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us."
"I know, but..."
It was a long time ago.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
"What do you want to know, Evan?"
"Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot."
Of course.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Not if you remember my dad.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
So how's Tommy?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Not since we were kids.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
"No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in."
"Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know..."
"God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?"
"Hi, Lenny."
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
"He must be. They're letting him go, right?"
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
"Duck, here they come."
I deserve a lot worse.
Damn. Your dad did this?
I'm sorry.
Ouch.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
"Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!"
Oh God... what did we do?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
"We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead."
"Been there, done that."
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
...yes.
Who -- who are you?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
What time is it?
Kayleigh? What happened?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
"Calm down, kid. Stand still."
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
"That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star."
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
"It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?"
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
"Damn, Evan, on the D.L."
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Me neither.
We'll find out soon enough.
"Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?"
Evan Treborn.
And you are...?
"Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due."
"I won't let you down, Professor Carter."
"Just don't drop the ball, okay?"
"Hey, I got no choice."
It didn't feel like a dream.
"Come on, go on..."
Deal. Now read me something.
Wow... read something.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Smells like sex in here.
So what's the point?
Destroy it?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What?
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Are you sure you even packed it?
"Uh, we should be getting to class now."
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
"Yeah, good, what else do you remember?"
I couldn't cut the rope.
"Gee, thanks friend."
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
"Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway."
Can... can... Can I have this?
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
"Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately."
Lung cancer?
"Listen to me good, Evan..."
"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
"No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy."
What the hell are you doing?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What's wrong with you?!
Look what you made me do!
What happened?? Where are we?!
"Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!"
"Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?"
"Fat little baby, crying for mommy."
"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
Sorry. Never heard of her.
"None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?"
Meant no offense.
I come from a big family.
Huh?
"Just get out, didja?"
"Aw, hey now, that was a compliment."
"Shut up, Tommy!"
Oh my God oh my God...
Lenny? Come on!
I'm sorry.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
"You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff."
I thought I was the bad guy!
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
"Yeah, you do that, Lenny."
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
"What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing."
"Here you go, buddy."
You're such a retard!
-- He's just a lucky guy.
"Monsieur Rick, I --"
Go back to Bulgaria.
"Oh, yes, please."
You want my advice?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
He always has.
-- Will he keep his word?
And you want to know --
"Yes, Monsieur."
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
"Oh, yes."
Does he know that?
"Yes, I'll bet."
So you decided to go to America.
How long have you been married?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
He did. Captain Renault did.
"-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?"
"No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --"
"Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so."
"Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?"
No.
"No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?"
"My husband is with me, too."
I should have known.
I came with Captain Renault.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
"Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?"
Yes?
Monsieur Rick?
I see.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
"In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight."
"I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo."
"A champagne cocktail, please."
"Yes, Monsieur."
"Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?"
I'm sorry. It is.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
"Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir."
What is your name?
Good.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
"Thank you, but I hardly think --"
Well?
"Yes, sir."
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
"Yes, I come, I will do it."
-- Tonight he forgot.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
"Yes, I come."
Come up here a minute.
"Goodnight, Monsieur Rick."
Goodnight.
I won't.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
"Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?"
"Oh, two weeks, maybe three."
How long can I afford to stay closed?
"Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick."
Monsieur Rick!
"No thanks, Carl."
"Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?"
That's all right.
"It shall not happen again, Monsieur."
Here you are.
I'm awfully sorry.
"-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time."
"I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --"
"Well, I'll get it from the safe."
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
"Er, goodbye, sir."
"I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you..."
"Er, my check, please."
I'd better be going.
"Er, good luck, yes."
"Here's to you, sir."
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
"Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes."
"Well, so long."
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
"Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?"
"Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too."
I'll tell him when he comes in.
And the carrying charges?
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Practically no one.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Suppose we do.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
What do you want for Sam?
It's not for sale at any price.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale.
"Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe."
"Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?"
"Hello, Rick."
Good day.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Rick?
Do you know where they are?
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
"Yes, something."
"Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?"
"You see, my dear, the word has gone around."
And the other alternative?
What are they?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Occupied France?
"That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France."
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
You needn't be concerned about me.
And Mademoiselle?
Yes.
And I said I would never leave you.
But what about us?
No.
"But Richard, no, I, I --"
"No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --"
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
I don't understand. What about you?
Because you're getting on that plane.
"But why my name, Richard?"
"Oh, Rick!"
Everything is quite all right.
"But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?"
"No, not yet."
"Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?"
I wish I didn't love you so much.
"All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid."
All except one. He won't have you.
And Laszlo?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
When did you first find out he was alive?
And then?
"For the last time, put them on the table."
No.
Put them on the table.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Please.
"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
"Richard, I had to see you."
The stairs from the street.
How did you get in?
"All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there."
You can believe that if you want to.
"I don't think I will, Rick."
"Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober."
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
I don't know the finish yet.
Has it got a wow finish?
"Can I tell you a story, Rick?"
I didn't count the days.
"Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?"
"Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel."
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Please.
Especially tonight.
"No. No, Rick. Not tonight."
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
"Oh, darling!"
That's too far ahead to plan.
"Yes, of course, we --"
"No, no, no, no. We must leave."
"But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris."
Strange. I know so very little about you.
"Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?"
Looking for a job.
"Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?"
"With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love."
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
My German's a little rusty.
"I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor."
"Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here."
"Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions."
"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Uh huh.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes?
And I was wondering.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
A franc for your thoughts.
"Here's looking at you, kid."
"We said ""no questions."""
He hasn't played it in a long time.
I will.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
"I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."
No.
Not an easy day to forget.
"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""
"Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it."
"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
"I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa."
"Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake."
"Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him."
"You used to be a much better liar, Sam."
Does he always leave so early?
"Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home."
When will he be back?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Where is Rick?
"Yes, ma'am."
"Some of the old songs, Sam."
"Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge."
It's been a long time.
"Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again."
"Hello, Sam."
"Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you."
Are you ready Ilsa?
"Of course, I'll be careful."
Be careful.
"-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear."
"I love you very much, my dear."
"No, Victor, there isn't."
"Yes, Victor, I was."
"When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?"
-- Yes?
"Ilsa, I --"
"Yes. He said, ""Ask your wife."" I don't know why he said that."
Ask me?
He suggested I ask you.
Did he give any reason?
Yes?
Apparently he has the letters.
"Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened."
"Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight."
Our faithful friend is still there.
We'll discuss it later.
What happened with Rick?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
"Yes, I would."
"No, Victor, no."
"Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty."
"We are only interested in two visas, Signor."
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
"I will, don't worry."
Be careful.
I must find out what Berger knows.
"We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?"
"Victor, I'm afraid for you."
This time they really mean to stop me.
Won't you join us?
You are very kind.
"Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here."
You're saying this only to make me go.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
"Well then, perhaps you also ---"
"Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?"
"Hello, Rick."
-- Is what?
"Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --"
Rick? Who's he?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Yes.
Sam?
"Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him."
Here it is.
I understand.
Yes.
"Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything."
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Everything in order?
"Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank."
No. It's all arranged.
But we made a deal.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
"I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine."
"Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do."
"Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you."
You love her that much?
You seem to know all about my destiny.
"Yes, I get the point."
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
"Yes, rather."
"Had a close one, eh?"
Thank you.
"Well, this might come in handy."
My wife?
"I said, ask your wife."
I beg your pardon?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
"I appreciate it, but I don't accept it."
What of it?
Right.
My office.
Go ahead.
"Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?"
"Good evening. You see, here we are again."
Good evening.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good morning.
Any time.
We'll come again.
Not at all.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We all try. You succeed.
Thank you. I try.
Your work.
What for?
And I congratulate you.
Won't you join us for a drink?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Are you quite finished with us?
"Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?"
I believe you have a message for him?
Yes.
"By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte."
-- Thank you.
"Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --"
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
"Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca."
"I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur."
Thank you.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
May we proceed with the business?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I slept very well.
Goodnight.
We'll be there.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
"Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!"
"No. Two champagne cocktails, please."
My bill.
Very well.
"No, Captain, please."
Yes. What is it you want?
"I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police."
Yes.
"Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?"
Good day.
For the time being.
You will give us the names?
Even in Berlin.
And that is?
Is that all you wish to tell us?
"Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical."
This is hardly the time or the place.
"I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil."
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Find one.
But I have no excuse to close it.
"Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed."
But everybody's having such a good time.
I see what you mean.
"A leader, like Laszlo?"
And if it should change?
"Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?"
"As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day."
Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle.
Perhaps.
"You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick."
"Of course, one must admit he has great courage."
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
How about New York?
"Ho, diplomatist!"
"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course."
"Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes."
"You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."
"How do you do, Mr. Rick?"
"Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich."
"I expected no less, Captain."
Thank you.
"May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine."
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
"Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major."
"Good evening, Captain."
"Good evening, gentlemen."
"I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself."
"By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?"
"What else, my dear Major?"
"You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major."
"Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle."
"Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here."
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
Uh huh.
Our expenses?
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
I think perhaps you're right.
"Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start."
"Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."
"As soon as the plane goes, Louis."
"Anyway, thanks for helping me out."
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
"You think of everything, don't you?"
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Put that gun down.
I have. Sit down over there.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Serves me right for not being musical.
Sam's piano.
"Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?"
I have the letters right here.
Is everything ready?
"You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky."
"Oh, he won't be followed here."
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You're late.
"Go ahead, Ricky."
"Oh, thanks."
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
"Well, she isn't just any woman."
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
What friend?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Huh?
"Well, they're all excellent reasons."
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
"I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!"
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Yeah? Why?
"As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist."
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Huh?
"Well, it looks like you're a little late."
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
"Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?"
"Oh, it's my party."
-- Thanks. I will.
"Oh, no, Rick never --"
"-- Hello, Ilsa."
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
"Oh, how do you do?"
Excuse me.
"Yeah, you were saying?"
"Oh, I see. Gestapo spank."
I have my orders.
"Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here."
The winning side would have paid you much better.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
He'll take one.
He is traveling with a lady.
Why two?
Okay.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Is that a serious offer?
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
This is the end of the chase.
"Oh, but I just told you. --"
His escape.
Manages what?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
"Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world."
"Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed."
Victor Laszlo?
Victor Laszlo.
Yeah? What's his name?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Perhaps not.
Our entertainment is enough.
A wise foreign policy.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
"This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less."
"What, again?"
Huh!
I was misinformed.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
It was a combination of all three.
The clipper to America.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
"When it comes to women, you're a true democrat."
"Hello, Louis."
Take your hands off me!
"Come on, we're going to get your coat."
"-- Sacha, call a cab."
"Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --"
"Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up."
"Sacha, she's had enough."
Give me another.
I never make plans that far ahead.
Will I see you tonight?
"That's so long ago, I don't remember."
Where were you last night?
Put it down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put that phone down!
Hello?
"I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you."
I would advise you not to interfere.
"Good evening, Mr. Blaine."
"You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon."
"Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too."
"In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?"
Are my eyes really brown?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
There seems to be no secret about that.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
I'm a drunkard.
What is your nationality?
"Make it official, if you like."
"Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!"
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
"Rick! Rick, help me!"
I don't want them here overnight.
"Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer."
For how long?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
"For a price, Ugarte, for a price."
"If I gave you any thought, I probably would."
No.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
"May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?"
-- You thought what?
"Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --"
"Well, what makes you think I haven't?"
Hello Ugarte.
"Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick."
"No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her."
Where is she? Have you seen her?
"You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid."
"Yes, boss."
"If she can stand it, I can. Play it!"
"Well, I don't think I can remember it."
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
"No, I don't."
"Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear."
Just a little something of my own.
What's that you're playing?
"Uh, my watch stopped."
"Yeah, boss?"
"No, sir. I'm staying right here."
"Shut up and go home, will you?"
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
"Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here."
"No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady."
"Boss, let's get out of here."
Then don't have a drink.
"No. Not me, boss."
Good. Then have a drink.
"Well, I ain't sleepy either."
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Not right now.
"Boss, ain't you going to bed?"
Yeah?
Boss!
Sorry.
"Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here."
He'll double what I pay you.
I like it fine here.
"Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot."
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Nobody remembers that.
Worse than Warsaw.
It's bad.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You can't make it.
Then we've just got shit.
"It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have."
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
Nothing out there but ocean.
It's real.
"Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage."
Jesus.
You are.
What's so damn funny?
Shut up.
"It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot."
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
They're on autopilot.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
"Yeah, sure, what?"
Die tomorrow or die today.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
"The sea is lovely, dark and deep."
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
No!
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Why do they have to die for me?
"You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die."
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
What are you doing?
"You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft."
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Water water water --
Fix raft first.
Get water!
I'm putting it off.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Moon's too bright.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
"Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south."
"Survive today, that's the point."
"If they can't see you, what's the point?"
"Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water."
No.
"Take it, damn it."
No.
Take it.
"No more water, you said."
Going to die anyway.
Do too little you'll die.
"Do too much, I'll die."
"No water, no work."
"Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it."
Thirsty.
You've had today's water.
Can't.  Need water.
"Get up, damn you."
Feels so good to lie here.
Get up.
"Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope."
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Save some for tomorrow.
Sure.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
"Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch."
No.  that was the last one.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
"Well, not really, I --"
"He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him."
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
"Well, I do a little drawing --"
Oh?  You've tried?
They're harder to do than they look.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Okay.  Sure.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
As much as anybody.
You know what happened to this?
No.
"Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up."
There was an unavoidable delay.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
So do I.
I've got lots of time.
"Yeah, a long one."
Must be a story there.
I had it on the island with me.
You?  Personally?
Had a package to deliver.
What brings you out to the sticks?
"I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled."
I'm so glad you're alive.
You too.
"I love you, Chuck."
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
It means a lot...that you came.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
What will you do?
Great.  Really.
You okay?
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
This is so unfair.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Not when you have no choice.
"So simple to say, so hard to do."
Come on.  Try.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Yeah?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
That about sums it up.
What was inside?
"Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing."
There was a coffin?
My epitaph.
"What's that, written on the sail?"
"Yeah, well...couldn't be helped."
What's that?
Is that Jango?
Her name's Hannah.
You have any children?
I would have done the same thing.
If I'd known you were alive --
I know.
I would never --
I thought you might have.
I got married.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
"Right back, you said you'd be right back."
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
"A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?"
"Chuck, you're breaking my heart."
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Get back?  From where?
Don't even start.
"Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back."
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I burned the Christmas tree.
"No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --"
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Yes there is.
There isn't any us.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
That's your dog.
I can't take him to work.
No.
Could you watch Jango?
"""We're"" not over-reacting."
"We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting."
This isn't working out.
You want to.
I have to.
You can't go now.
"Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go."
You did?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
For when I travel?
"You know, for when you travel."
And for you --
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I can't even keep fish alive.
He's your cute thing.
He is a cute thing.
"Hey, look at you."
"Let me guess, Russia came up?"
"Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better."
You don't seem too happy about it.
Four four.  A record.
Not if you work for FedEx.
Merry Christmas eve.
"Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it."
Chuck.
"Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?"
Got to follow the paper path here.
I thought I did.
Cold.
How was Russia?
Let's take a look.
"My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed."
You smell like formaldehyde.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
"Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you."
Sonofabitch!
"There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney."
Anything else?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
When's the next Jumbo?
Terrific.  Yours?
And how was your Christmas?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Not to mention on me.
"Yes, yes he did."
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
I most definitely say I am.
If you say you are.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
I am one lucky guy.
Which I didn't have.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Yeah.
You're Chuck Noland.
Sure.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
No.
"You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?"
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Need some help?
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Really?
"True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know."
But chickens?
So did I.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Let's eat.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
I wanted to come here.
When'd you start working here?
"Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me."
I'm doing fine.
The place is falling apart.
Don't you even think about it.
"Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought."
"That new roof, that's your doing."
"It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me."
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
"Mom, meet Jango."
What happened to your pants?
Can you find her?
"Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account."
"Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check."
What about the sender?
"Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?"
Trying.
"Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?"
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
What's going on down there?
"It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter."
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Kamal is not here.
No sweat.
Thanks.  For everything.
"Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you."
I need to do it.
"You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do."
"Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno."
"What, then?"
"Deep, real deep."
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
That's what it's about.
What?
Take your time.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Digital laser readers.
Believe me I know.
That's all there is.
To life.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
"I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon..."
Hallelujah.
"You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!"
To Wilson.
To Wilson.
"When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles."
Forty-three days.
You were how long on this?
Time I had lots of.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
I braided them.
Cool ropes.
You should have smelled me.
This stinks really bad.
Want to see my raft?
How about we go somewhere else?
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Hello.
"You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!"
I beat the odds!
"I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker."
You're fucking dead!
It's me.
"God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!"
"Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland..."
Hello?
"Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia."
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
We're on.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
"I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --"
You are one sick fucker.
For the third time.
That's why you're a gambling man.
Forget it.
And never take.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
"Baloney.  I do see the damn ""big picture."""
"Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point."
I was making a point.
You fucked us over.
I'm touched.
But I might not have.
It was fifteen minutes late.
You what?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
How'd it go?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
"As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself."
San Francisco.  And you?
"May I ask, where are you bound?"
Permission granted.
"Permission to come aboard, sir."
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
Dr. Homer Wells.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
"Wilbur, he picked them for us himself..."
These *credentials* are against the law!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
"This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!"
"It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur."
"Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes."
"He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy."
He'll need clothes... some money...
"Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any ""new help."""
They just want you to hire some new help.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
"It was just the ether, Wilbur..."
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
I was!
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
Life is waiting.
"Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office."
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
"It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue..."
"Try to think of nothing, Dorothy."
Only if you can afford it.
What's she so emotional about?
I doubt it. She's just an...
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
I know.
"Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't."
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Better than I can!
And that I can drive a truck!
You cook very well!
"Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little."
"What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?"
"Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway."
Why not?
I mean your parents.
"I'm sorry, Homer."
I'm *not* a doctor!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
"*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether."
"He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether."
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
"She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*..."
What'd she die of?
"Good night, Daddy."
"Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already."
"Daddy, *please*..."
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
"Good night, Daddy."
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
"Wally said to say, ""Hello."""
"He mentions Homer, too, you know."
"Daddy, it's a letter to *me*."
It's time somebody ate *them*.
"No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me."
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
Sure. Thanks.
She knows how to take care of herself.
Do you think she'll be all right?
"And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you..."
Please don't...
"""...did."" Well, okay."
"Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did."
"No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you."
Please don't make me say it again.
What do you want me to *do*?
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
He's *paralyzed*!
"I know, I'm sorry."
"For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!"
Stop it! Just cut it out!
"If you're trying to be funny, Homer..."
"Please don't move, don't go anywhere."
"No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want..."
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Nothing.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Mr. Rose *knows*?
You don't understand! It's her father...
"Well, we can't force her. It's her decision."
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
"Well, we have to help her!"
"It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?"
"Okay, okay--I know you do, too."
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
*What* will be okay?
It will be okay.
Right.
I *know* this was right.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Just a little privacy.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
You don't miss it?
At least you were never lonely.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
What's the *medical* explanation?
"Oh, sure!"
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
"And what did she die of, exactly?"
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
"I *did* like it. All I said was, ""It's not 'King Kong'."""
But you looked as if you liked it.
"""King Kong"". It's really good."
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
"Yes! I've only seen one, though."
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
People watched the movies in their cars?
"Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout."
A movie *outside*?
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
I better go.
Okay...
"You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then."
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
So. Not bored yet?
Sure... I'll see you around.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I understand.
Oh...
Burma!
Where's Mandalay?
I know.
"I've never seen the ocean, either."
Really?
I've never seen a lobster.
"No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman."
"Is your family in the apple business, too?"
Two.
How many months are you?
Candy. Candy Kendall.
"So, Mrs..."
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Why?
I can't go nowhere.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
"Yes, I *have*!"
"You ain't been through what I been through, Candy."
"I don't need no more clothes, thank you."
Hi...
Hi...
"Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places..."
How is that Wally doing?
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I know what you've been doing.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
"I love you, too. See you tomorrow."
"I love you, Wally."
"Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!"
There! You said it was boring.
"Well, they aren't."
"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""
I never said they were boring.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I'm okay--I can walk.
"Well, this *is* an orphanage."
So many children. Are they all orphans?
"Only the right people can have you, Curly."
You mean somebody asked?
"Nobody special enough, Curly."
"Nobody's asked for me, have they?"
That's true.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
"You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you."
Nobody ever wants me!
They wanted a girl.
I thought they might take me.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
I just wanted to ask you...
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
"Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
"""...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."""
"Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?"
"""Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."""
He's leaving...
That's a heavy sedation.
"How old are you, dear? Thirteen?"
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Someone not from Maine.
What's an immigrant?
No. She was an immigrant.
Did you grow up around here?
She looks after other people's children.
What's a nanny do?
"She's dead now, too. She was a nanny."
Did you know your mother better?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
But did you know him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
*Liver* killed him?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Is *your* father dead?
"Don't get too excited, Fuzzy."
Is that soon?
Uh... it's the end of October.
"His father's dead, right?"
That's why Kong loves her!
"Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right."
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
"No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep."
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
I don't remember.
Did you bite it?
"I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one."
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
What about the trees?
It's almost like flying.
Migrants?
They're migrants.
"Oh, I would love that, Wally."
"Actually, I volunteered."
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
At what altitude?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma..."
It's all very normal.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
"No, I'm not. I need a job."
"You're a little overqualified, aren't you?"
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Where are you going?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
"Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything."
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Really! Is it serious?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Have you enlisted?
Liberator...
A B-24 Liberator.
What kind of plane are you flying?
"Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered..."
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
"So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--"
It's okay--I don't mind.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Right?
"There's more than one laceration, more than one cut."
Where'd she get you?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
"I'm stayin', Homer."
"Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze."
"There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?"
What's that? What's it called?
"What business is you in, Homer?"
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
But she's your *daughter*...
"Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes."
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
"Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows."
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
"I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer."
Is it true?
You still doin' it too fast!
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
"Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry."
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
I guess so...
Okay...
Right.
So. What should I do now?
I am not a doctor.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I don't need your gratitude.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Of course.
"In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways."
"Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?"
I'm happy I amuse you.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I thought it was my turn.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
"Okay, he's just a Wilbur then."
"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
You do it then.
I don't think so.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
"He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why."
It's my turn!
Nobody's named this one yet.
Where's the name sheet?
"But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?"
I haven't read that.
"In other words, scurvy."
I don't know it.
"Christ, it's oil of tansy!"
Obviously.
It's obviously an aborticide.
It looks like scurvy.
There was no visible wound?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
"Yes, for both."
First pregnancy?
Right.
"Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?"
Uh... sure.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
"I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me."
"Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here."
"""Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."""
"We heard that one already, Homer."
"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
"How long's this been going on, Muddy?"
"Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you."
That's it.
That's *it*?
"Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen..."
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
"Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you."
But you don't look very happy.
"Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business."
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
"You're not yet three months, are you?"
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
"You okay, Rose?"
Almost.
"Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?"
Give men that. I know how to do it.
"Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is."
I'm not in trouble.
No trouble.
"You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope."
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Do you like to read?
"Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect."
So what?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
It's just my heart.
What's that?
"Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?"
Rose Rose?
"What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is..."
"Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!"
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
"Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter."
Shit. We don't know what he is.
"Now, now. He's a good boy."
Who cares?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Do you know him?
"Four weeks or so, right around Halloween."
"When will he be home, Major?"
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Then it's malaria?
Why was he missing for twenty days?
"They're *outrageous*, them rules!"
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
"You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that."
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
It look nicer then home!
Don't this place look like home?
We see you next harvest.
"You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!"
"Sorry, Homer..."
"Mind your own business, Peaches."
"Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?"
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
They told me I was too old to serve.
"That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?"
"*You* taught her, I suppose..."
"Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today."
I told him that you all is sick.
"Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy."
*What* view?
What view?
"Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view."
"That's right, Homer. This ain't your business."
"You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help."
"I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go."
"You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!"
"You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please..."
Where do you think you're going?
"You just stay out of trouble, Homer!"
"Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right."
"Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in."
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
"That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer."
What's lucky about that?
"You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl..."
"Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night."
He ain't never been outta Maine!
"You ever see a palm tree, Homer?"
"She took off on the bicycle, man."
She took off in the night!
Rose Rose has runned away!
"Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed."
"The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*..."
"You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man."
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
"Oh. Well, thanks for the drink."
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
"No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank."
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Can --
Silicon Valley?
"So, what do you do?"
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
"Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks."
Tough day?
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
"Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --"
Two million.
Ten percent. Of how much?
The standard ten.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Let's just slow down for a second...
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
What's this?
There'll be red flags.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
This has to happen fast.
Everything looks in order.
We had to finalize the deal.
And you have this letter of intent?
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
I don't follow.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
"A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part."
"Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --"
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
"What do you do over at your bank, Grant?"
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
"Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?"
Guess so.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Today? Started off great...
"Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?"
She walked.
After you cut her loose.
We were back on.
It's not true.
I was doing it for them.
"Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?"
She had you tempting fate.
Like what?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Nice.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
But there were other factors.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
I can see why you liked her.
So how'd you get caught?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keeping the Fix happy.
And these cops? What do they get?
Isn't it always?
"It's all about the money, isn't it?"
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Grifters...
That's not a bad place to start.
Just the last three weeks.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Gee... What makes you say that?
"Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake."
The Anti-Christ?
"Know who I am, Jake?"
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
"Ten is standard, sir."
We'll take care of it.
So we go to the bar.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
"It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake..."
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Fuck that. We're going too.
We're going to give him the money back?
Whoa. What?
Come on...
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
"So what? We hide, right?"
Mob?
"Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses."
What's a King Pin?
Who's that?
"Jake, I mean, come on --"
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
"Let's go, Jake?"
I'm going home
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Jake...
"So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?"
Masters of our own destiny.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
"I'd like this cashed, please."
That's it.
So that's it...
Jake --
We'll use the Euc.
Calls?
Eight A.M. flight.
You'll be there?
"We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over."
You sure?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
She's up for it.
She up for this?
"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
"Yeah... Whatever, Jake."
We pay better.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Two million.
How much we going after?
"Yes, her. Where's my wallet?"
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
Tonight. Just me.
When?
And what about Big Al?
You know what we're doing with the money.
"Well, this is just fucking great..."
"I just don't know if this says, ""me"". What's the fabric?"
It can buy you a new and better you.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
"I told you, use less powder."
Shit.
"Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy."
I think I just broke my hand.
Come on. Harder.
Come here!
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here. Feel this.
"Look at you, you skinny prick."
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Excuse me?
"Listen, Scooter --"
"Hey Skippy? Do I have the word ""chump"" tattooed on my forehead?"
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
Stake you?
I need you to stake me.
I think two million.
How much?
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Why?
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
No. Just confidence.
"Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much."
"Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you..."
Because you killed one of my crew.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Why not?
I can't do that.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
You can't cheat an honest man.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Minus one.
Minus one.
I have a good crew.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Good boy.
Something stupid.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
"Ring it for him, Sobo."
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
"Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business."
"Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed."
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
"Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces."
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Sure.
Very much so.
Attractive girl.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
"What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?"
Great. Thank you.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
"Sorry, I --"
What about... The money?
Help me.
What -- What do we do?
Oh Jesus!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
"No, I want my cut!"
What do you want? An apology?
"You tell them the ""Tale""."
You got my cell. Leave a message.
"Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you."
Sorry. I didn't know...
"No, I want my cut!"
What about the money?
What about what?
What about...
"Everyone's working an angle, right?"
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Jesus... Take it easy.
"You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too."
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
"Did, uh... Did you kill him?"
Lily... Jesus Christ...
"Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him."
He was looking out for you.
Glenn talked you out of it.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
"Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me."
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Sounds respectable.
"I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?"
WHAT?
How do you deal with --
Don't ruin this for me.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Intuition.
How do you know I will?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
It's more than that.
"I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it."
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Do you have something to prove?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
It's what I do. It's my job.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Look at you... You want to go.
Did I miss something?
You told me to change my hair!
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Lighten up.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
He's gone.
Uh... Everything okay?
Then show me how.
I don't trust anyone.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Why?
And some new clothes.
What?
You need to get a haircut.
Don't worry about it.
What the hell's his problem?
"Mr. King, I think --"
I'll worry about Customs.
What about Customs?
Just play a part. A little acting.
What do I have to do?
You get an equal cut.
No.  What's my cut?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Says who?
You interested in a little work?
That's not --
We're not cops.
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Jake? Customs?
And we got rid of the red head.
And we got rid of the red head.
Escorts!
What do we do? We change the scam?
Where the hell is she?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
You sure?
Him.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Is it all fugasi?
We're getting a little old for running.
"Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before."
We never had a problem with that before.
"Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?"
"Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea..."
Good point.
"I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?"
What?
Uh...
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Why?
Breasts.
What do we need another Shill for?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
We're working for the King.
I'm getting a ride.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Meet me at my place later.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
It's bad luck.
Miles...
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Yeah.
You sure we're clear?
Stop waving that thing around.
My place.
Then shut up.
Your mess.
"If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up."
Tick-tock...
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
With identification.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
What was it?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Do you have a ticket?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Sorry. What?
Eee Oott Auught!
What happened?
"No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-"
Stand up.
What?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Keep it up.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
That was fucking deep.
You're a weasel.
What'd he say?
"Point, Lupus. Give us a point."
My fucking heart bleeds.
Of what? They're both crooks.
"Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet."
King ain't gonna like this.
I'll find the time.
You going to have the time?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Still time.
"Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want."
So what do you want?
It's not history.
I can handle it.
The King.
Then who's the Banker?
Can't say.
A little bit of both.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Pretty much.
"Aces, Suits."
Just a tip.
I try.
"The King, huh? Nice going."
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Confidence. It's just confidence.
"You guys got sack, I'll give you that much."
Ten percent.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Speak.
A Fed? Is he close?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
What?
We're here.
You guys awake?
Let's just say he burned me once.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Did he buy it?
"Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature."
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Special Agent?
Roger that.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
"Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?"
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
"Not everyone's on the take, Walter."
That's it?
Peace of mind.
What do you get out of it?
What do you want?
Who?
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
High five.
What are you doing?
I'm down!
That's what I'm talking about.
It's just insurance.
You trust this Moonan guy?
"Whoa, whoa... There he is."
To who?
You sell it.
A couple I know are getting married.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
You're all scumbags.
"Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt."
I don't know anything about it.
What are you talking about?
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Sorry.
Ouch.
"Not like Matt, you mean."
The Indian rope-trick.
I despise the job.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I can imagine.
I got scared.
Why did you quit?
All men are cheats.
I hate cheats.
It's the tension.
You're shaking.
Goodnight.
I'll take you up on that.
Maybe another time.
My car's in the garage.
No. Thanks.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
How do I look?
Is it that bad?
"Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit."
Jack Manfred.
I'm Bella.
Seven-fifty.
Eight-fifty.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
What?!
How about five hundred.
How about fifteen hundred?
"That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition."
What's the Blue Book price?
What kind of deal you looking to?
"You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business."
How's that football story corning along?
Not entirely.
"A bit unexpected, wasn't it?"
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
And your lady?
Not particularly.
Good night?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
I get it.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Last hand.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
I don't gamble.
She.
Who was he?
I found her in bed with someone.
South African women are very sporty.
"She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend."
Looking forward!
I'll try and make it.
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Habib?
"Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib."
I'm working on that soccer story.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
All right. As what?
"I want a job, Giles."
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
We all played the field.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
She went back to South Africa.
"Three years, two months. March '93."
How can anyone be that naive?
I want to buy a car.
What?
I hate public transport.
Why did you take the money?
You're already alone.
"Leave me alone, Marion."
Here...use a spoon.
Then what?
Nothing about you.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
"There was a message, wasn't there?"
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
How did you know I was here?
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Really?
Gambling's not about money.
"I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time..."
Never. Why do you ask?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Not talking. Writing.
You were talking in your sleep.
What?
"Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!"
You will?
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
You're entitled to your opinion.
"That girl, she works at the casino --"
It will.
I hope it brings you luck.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
No. Answer it!
Leave it.
"The door, Jack."
Without hope there's no point to anything.
It's the truth.
Marion. It's a book.
Why not?
I don't like it.
"Well, that's our life now, isn't it?"
I'm on at nine.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What about a drink on the way home?
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
You're my conscience.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
"Marion, stop this."
Do you have to swear all the time?
Probably.
Are you drunk?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
"Don't play the cop with me, Marion."
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
I'll see you in my dreams.
"When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep."
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I loved it blond.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
Tension. It'll go.
You're shaking. What is it?
Fine.
How did it go?
I don't know.
What's the time?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Are you trying to read my palm?
"I love you Jack, you know that."
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I start Monday week.
I had training. In the Republic.
It came my way. 450 a week.
How did you land that?
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
What job?
I've got a job.
I want to hear it.
I've got something to tell you.
You're my prisoner.
"Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it."
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I. sold the car.
Where did you get it?
Turn around.
"It's not just inner beauty, is it?"
You really are a beautiful woman.
I won't be that long.
You want me drunk?
"No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer."
You mean I won't resist them.
I couldn't resist them.
"I won't.  Goodbye, dad."
Don't let yourself down.
"Yes, I know that."
"So how are you doing, dad?"
"All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him."
It's not that.
No.
Found a job?
Great.
Did you solve your problems?
"Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am."
How are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Jani! Where are you?
Jack! It's Jani.
Hello...
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
I don't think we should meet again.
No thank you.
Would you like a drink?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
And your hand too.
I've still got mine.
"Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better."
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Yes.
Do you?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
"Well, life's not fair. We know that."
Thank you.
Yes.
Is it yes?
I have to take the car.
What for?
I'm sorry.
"I told you, all bets are off."
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Let it go.
How much do you owe?
"No, forget it. The bet's off."
Wait a minute...
I want you to forget what I said.
"I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend."
"I can't do it, Jani."
What about my neck?
Next time it'll be my neck.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
What ten thousand pounds?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
But if it does.
It won't.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
And I thought you were only after my body.
You're serious.
Robbery's not criminal?
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
"The point is, they want a man inside."
"Forget it, Jani. It'll never work."
Who's they?
They mean it.
"Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion."
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
I know that. But you can now.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I owe a lot of money.
What kind of trouble?
I'm in trouble.
Then you're not a pro.
I didn't.
"It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it."
"That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before."
You choose.
Which side do you like?
"You don't like cheats, do you."
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
What happened?
I'll watch.
He doesn't gamble.
That's fine.
Turn left ahead.
Just an accident. Nothing.
How did you hurt your hand?
I don't gamble.
Toss you for it.
Absolutely not.
"Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology."
Do you believe in astrology?
"We all came from Africa, supposedly."
"That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?"
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
The debts.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Your father?
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
In the casino.
Near the casino.
"I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast."
First visit to London?
So why did you come to my casino?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
There's a casino in this hotel.
To coincidence.
Impossible to calculate.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Oh hello.
"Well, thank you anyway."
I've lived there.
You know where I'm from?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
You did?
Of course I recognised him!
Who did it? Tell me!
Ross.
Who...
Detective Inspector Ross.
Turn left at the lights.
Where to?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I might.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
"And what do you do, Lucy?"
I'm Lucy.
Have I?
You've been avoiding me.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'll tell you later.
What happened to Bella?
"Rough life, Jack."
Rough day?
Don't worry.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I don't gamble.
"Don't worry, I won't report you!"
No thanks.
"Hey Jack, join us."
That bitch? No.
Does Bella come here?
Good call. Help yourself.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
And the girls?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Who are these guys?
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
You're talking about complicity.
"If I see you do it again, I'll report it."
"What are you, a cop?"
I'm not going to report it.
"I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong."
What the fuck are you talking about?
Some other time.
"No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours."
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
"Not bad. I have other interests, of course."
You've done pretty well.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
How long have you worked at the casino?
She's my baby.
Nice car.
Thanks.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Have you got transport?
Over the river.
"Where do you live, Jack?"
"It was you, you shit."
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
"I'm afraid that's not so, sir."
I put them on together.
"What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady."
"I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet."
Bruised.
"How do you feel, Jack?"
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Thanks for the information.
I can see.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
He's a good customer.
Does he win?
"Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella."
"All right, Mr Reynolds."
"Why don't you take a break, Jack."
"Jack, you're not the usual type we get here."
I just want the job.
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
Fine.
You can start Monday week.
Very impressive.
No.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Yes.
Girlfriend?
How?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
"I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds."
Ever?
I don't gamble.
What for?
I said good call.
You want me to check?
Good call.
What makes you so sure?
Five.
I make it six.
Five.
How many aces are left?
You won't. Not without permission.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
"Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched."
Wipe your hands.
I don't think so.
Haven't you forgotten something?
They've been tested.
Where's the magnet?
We do.
"You use two alternating, don't you?"
Give me 365.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Any exceptions?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Why four? And not three or five?
We check every four days.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
"I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose."
I was at Beadles.
Where did you go to school?
No.
Has he?
Jack.
"David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John."
"Yoo hoo, bomb..."
What the hell?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
"What was that, I didn't hear..."
"Doolittle, are you there?"
We've got to disarm the bomb.
"Boiler, we're alive. My heart."
It didn't go off.
"Oh, God..."
It didn't go off.
"We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die."
Where is the key?
"Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!"
"The key, goddamit, the key!"
"You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!"
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
The key!
Where's the fail-safe key?
Key?
"No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!"
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
I think he's talking to it.
What's he doin'?
"Look, bomb..."
"I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand."
Eventual supernova.
"Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?"
Yeah.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Oh. What's wrong now?
"The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero."
What flickering light?
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
"Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical."
"Right, that checks out here."
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
"Talby, can you read me?"
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
"Talby, Talby, can you read me?"
-- open quantum latches --
Rechannel all safety relays --
I read the same here.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
"He just likes it up in the dome, that's all."
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
"Pinback, throw me the chart log."
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
"All right, then..."
"Well, there's the possibility of..."
"Well, it is kind of a long shot..."
Fuck that shit.
"Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula..."
"Find me something, I don't care where it is."
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
"Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?"
Time to start talking.
"Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven."
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Thanks.
Armed.
"Arm yourself, bomb."
Check at six minutes.
"Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds."
Energy shielding positive function.
And I saw that I was alone.
"Hey, bomb..."
"Snap out of it, bomb."
Bomb?
The only thing which exists is myself.
"Hey, bomb."
"Hello, bomb."
"Therefore, I shall ignore you."
Huh?
You are false data.
No.
Thanks.
"Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck."
Armed.
"Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself."
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Energy shielding positive function.
"Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue."
You have no proof that it was correct data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
...nine seconds...
So if you detonate in...
Hmmm...
"That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate."
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
"Yes, well..."
Of course not.
That is correct.
"And you can only do it once, right?"
"To explode, of course."
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Why don't you have more time?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
That's it.
Exactly.
This is fun.
Right!
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
"Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am."
It is intuitively obvious.
But how do you know you exist?
Well of course I exist.
"Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?"
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Of course.
"Hello, bomb, are you with me?"
"Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?"
"Hello, Pinback, are you there?"
"Oh, sure."
"5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!"
-- Remark.
-- automatic channels open --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- open circuit breakers --
"Ah, negative drop."
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Who cares?
Veil nebula.
Out where?
"Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?"
I hereby name this star Fred.
Wha?
Fred.
"Come on, Doolittle, give it a name."
Commander Powell is dead.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
What?
What are you gonna name it?
Naah. All stable.
Any of 'em any good?
"Yeah. Eight, it says here."
Any planets?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Which one?
"New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout."
"Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?"
In a second.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Yes.
Doolittle...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
"Yes, Doolittle."
Pinback...
I'll check it.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
"Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?"
Mafhkin oble groop...
"Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?"
Yeah?
"I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle..."
No kidding?
Phoenix?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Oh yeah?
Guess you're right.
"Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it."
"What happened, Doolittle?"
"Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?"
"Calm down, Talby. I'm coming."
Doolittle! Help me.
"Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --"
Not now!
"Sh, Talby, don't bother me now."
"Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?"
"Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up."
"Yes, Talby, what is it?"
"Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?"
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
"I'm getting something here, on this readout..."
"You know what I think about, Talby?"
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
"...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship..."
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I like it up here.
"Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute."
I need a diameter approximation.
"Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?"
TALBY!
"Yeah, the skipper always was lucky."
"Men... men... what happened, men?"
Phenomenology...
Sir?
"No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle."
"I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now."
Talk to the bomb.
Sir?
"We're running out of time, sir."
"Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking."
Commander? Are you still there?
"What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?"
Sorry.
"Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute."
"Doolittle, hello?"
"Commander Powell? Commander, hello!"
"Well, what you might try is --"
"What should we do, sir? The time is running out."
"Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much."
"That's correct, sir."
It didn't work?
Negative effect.
"What was that, Doolittle?"
Yes sir. Negative effect.
"You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop."
"Ah... pity, pity..."
"Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago."
"Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?"
"What's that, sir?"
"Doolittle, you must tell me one thing."
This.
"How I make my living, what's your point?"
No?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bruno's girlfriend.
Who are you?
None of your business.
Who's Camille?
What the hell are you doing?
"Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk."
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
"This is what your life's worth, Bruno."
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
How come I never hearda you before?
That's a lotta crap.
What're you talkin' about?
"You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap."
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
That's not why we're here.
What?
"Actually, that's not gonna be necessary."
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
"I like to keep it professional, that's all."
"Man, you got a bad attitude."
Yeah?
"Yeah, sure, I understand."
No wire.
Guess again.
I'm on a break.
Where?
Move it.
No.
Can I say something in my defense?
Leave.  Now.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
You know each other?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Could you give us a moment.
"And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt."
She was there...
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
You're not still pissed?
You mean until you showed up?
"How're ya doin', Max."
Don't look down.
But I'm afraid of--
No way.
Out there.
No time.
Lemme put some clothes on.
What?  Where're we going?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Police drone.
What is it?
You're roommates?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What are you doing here?
Why would I be pissed?
"Theo rode for this place a long time, man."
Which is none of your business...or mine.
I got overhead...
"So Max, what do you do with all your money?"
Am I?
You're light a deuce.
It's a rule.
I'll make it worth your while.
I don't get involved with guns.
Later.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I ain't mad at you...
A grand.
What're you looking for?
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Where'd you clip this?
Every week.
You didn't...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
"And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either."
What a creep.
Yech...
"Yeah, me too."
"Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human."
"Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy."
Hello...
What else can we do?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
"Look, I'd really like to..."
Can you help me get her back?
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
I know.
They took my daughter.
Damn... Are you alright?
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
"Mommy, I'm scared."
"Soon, baby."
When?
"Don't worry, I'm coming to get you."
"Mommy, where are you?"
Sophy?  Are you okay?
What makes you cry?
No...
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
But why can't we stay here?
I don't want to move away.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
With your help.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
We're quoting Mom again.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
"Look, thank you for this but--"
"Deeds, not words.  I need your help."
I don't know what to say.
Open it.
What's this?
"That's what soldiers do, right?"
"Well, not me personally."
You believe that?
I'm sorry.
"I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?"
Somebody's got to.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
"She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me."
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
"Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something."
"That's low, but this effects me how exactly?"
I already don't like the sound of this.
Your help.
What's in it for you?
You said you could help.
"Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best."
Hardly...
Your basic hodge-podge.
A girl.
"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."
How much do you know?
How well do you remember the lab?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
You did go through my stuff.
You lost me.
The other one like you...
The other ones?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
"Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?"
"No, I meant this."
"C'mere, I want to show you something."
You need to get out more.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Yes on all counts.
"Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--"
We are not fine.
"It's alright, Peter, we're fine."
"Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this."
"You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here."
"That would be appropriate, yes."
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
"So saw my hands off, I left you a present."
How do I know you didn't?
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
Bent.
Bent?
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
You got a lotta nerve.
It was open.
I'm not a half bad cook.
I won't be staying.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Yeah...
Is the social studies class over for today?
Something.
So what are you gonna do about it?
"So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?"
"Fortunately, my needs are met in that department."
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Girlfriend?
Lauren's not my wife.
Too early to tell.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Wasn't that hard.
How'd you find me?
The one you're wearing?
Lemme get my coat.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Sorry about your window.
Logan Cale.
"Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--"
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Who is...
"No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast."
"So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?"
Whoever that is.
"You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus."
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I was expecting someone else.
First time I ever heard that.
Thank God.
Girl's gotta make a living.
You're a thief?
I'll wait.
None.
Any idea when she'll be back?
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
Can't help you.
I need to talk to her.
But she does work here?
You don't want to.
Know where I can find her?
Ladies would be elsewhere.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
I understand.
"Say the words, ""I understand."""
"Okay, okay."
"Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help..."
Let go of my hand.
This is not a place you wanna go.
I think you should go now.
You're also a fool.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
"Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month."
Oh?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
"Look, I don't know what you want--"
How do I know you're telling the truth?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Who are you?
What do you want?
A friend of your fiance's.
Who is it?
I'm on my way.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Got a pencil?
"Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day."
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
You and me both.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Bastard...
"I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can."
You're crazy.
"Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations."
How's this about me?
Here's your money.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
As long as you're okay.
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Nothing on Hannah?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Then what?
Thank you.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
"Sorry, I was seven at the time."
Right here someplace.
"You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid."
"Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here."
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
You did.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
"But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario."
"Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie."
Only one I can think of.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
So are dogs.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Please...
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because he's my friend.
Unlikely.
"Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson."
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
It's a secret.
Where?
Gotta go.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
A fog bank.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
"Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?"
A long time.
How long you and me known each other?
"If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking."
You know what I'm saying.
A little what?
Yeah.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
No.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
What?
That's odd...
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Straight.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
"Morning, Sunshine..."
You get it when I get her.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
She's got my word.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Make the call.
I have sincere eyes.
And she bought that?
"So, how do you get the woman to come to me?"
Pull the cash.
"What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?"
Who are you?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I actually know how this works.
"Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds."
"Not right now?  Okay, when?"
Not right now.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
"Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues."
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Tell everybody hey.
What if he's on the level?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Playing hooky again?
"You're the best, Maxie."
"It's payday, need me to pick up your check?"
Shut-up...
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
"Say the words, ""I understand."""
"Okay, okay, okay--"
"True, but--"
She was the one--
"She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic."
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
"No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes."
Easy Sketchy.
"You rock, Max.  You... Rock..."
You don't.
"Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?"
I'll give it my best shot.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
How'd you get her out of town?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
--a philandering pig.
She tells you how I've been--
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
And why should she?
What happens if you level with her?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
A toy?
I'm a toy to her.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Lydia.
Does this person have a name?
"Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--"
Exactly.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Really?
I'm the victim here.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
But there's another side--
You left out condescending.
"Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged."
Max--
"Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?"
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
What's up?
We gotta talk.
"Hey, Sketchy--"
But I'll take a rain check...
"Right, the big one-oh."
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Later.
Catch you back at the wall.
Theo's dead.
What about this?
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
For a change.
He's sick.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I want you on call here.
I was on call.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
"Well, shame on him if he doesn't."
"He's a little spoiled, but I know he does."
"And he loves you back, doesn't he?"
More than anything in the world.
"No, I mean... you love your son?"
"I just told you, he's a big, hairy..."
You love him?
"My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw..."
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Gin.
What the hell is that?
Huh?
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
"Thanks, miss."
I-I c-can't...
"Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't..."
Whoa... she is a killer.
"Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all."
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
What's that?
"Yeah, a man's drink..."
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Got any KISS?
"Pick a song, Hawk."
Hawk.
Bye.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
"Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?"
Ann Arbor?
"I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here."
"Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?"
"Oh, screw it!"
"Right, slow..."
We've got to take this slow...
You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Believe it.
Beth? I can't believe it.
Yeah?
Jeremiah?
It's okay.
Sorry.
Thanks.
No problem.
Whatever... stella.
"You got in the car, didn't you?"
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
What? That's disgusting!
"So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What's it worth to you?
"Plenty, but it was all bad."
Any luck?
One more time in English.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
"Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize."
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
"Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?"
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
What's in Sandusky?
"Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk."
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Namely?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Yeah.
"What are you, high?"
Nah. Couldn't be.
No... You don't think...?
Tickets?
I found the Volvo.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
I think we should try sneaking in.
"Cool, bro, now listen up..."
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
DUDES!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Uh... dudes?
The paint!
What the fuck!
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
"Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think."
"Now, how are we gonna do this?"
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
"Ok, dudes, follow my lead."
Curly.
"Sunday, but..."
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Damn straight we are.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
"So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?"
"But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!"
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Weird...
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Whoa... she just farted.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Check!
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
"Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them."
"Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it."
"YO, DOOFUS!"
"Shit, that dork is Jam."
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Sure.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
"Oh, yeah...?"
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
"Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?"
Are you gettin' wise with me?
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Could be.
"Hey, disco dude, it's cool..."
"Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow."
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
"You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot."
The easy way.
"Dude, this is all I got."
"Go ahead, Jam."
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
"See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later."
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
"Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us."
I got...
"I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do."
"Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels."
It was stolen!
"Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me."
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
"Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice."
"What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?"
Check.
"If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?"
Check.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
They're what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
"I'm really sorry about that, man."
Cool.
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
What's gone?
"Anyway, listen up. They're gone!"
It's my Bullworker.
"Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary."
Hawk?
"Jam, listen up."
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
"Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah."
"Mom, what're we...?"
"I said, I'm sorry!"
What?!
"If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him."
"You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?"
"You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome."
Grounded for the rest of the year?
They're not idiots.
"Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis."
"But, mom!"
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
"Ahh, sunshine."
Uhh... nothing.
"Jeremiah, what are you doing?"
NOW!
"Oh, hi, mom."
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
A bustier?
"No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that."
Was it a teddy?
Well? Continue! Continue!
"Oh, this is terrible... Please go on."
No...
No.
Yeah.
That's it?
"Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy."
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
But we took the keys?
"I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?"
It's gone.
Let's lift up her shirt.
"Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!"
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
"Well, here we are back at fucking school again."
Hello summer detention.
"Simplicity, Hawk."
We won?!
I did it! I did it! We won!
"Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug."
"Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?"
"Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!"
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
"Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass."
What?
"Trip, you fuckin' asshole."
"You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke."
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Two hundred bucks?
"It's not nearly enough, punk."
"Look, you can have my wallet..."
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
What do you want?
"Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event."
"Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba..."
"A likely story. Hand it over, kid."
Neither do I!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Not if I shoot first!
"Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!"
"No, you gimme your gun, boy!"
"Gimme your gun, boy!"
The KISS Army!
"Oh, yeah! You and what army?"
"Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!"
"Yeah, you did!"
I did?
Yeah.
Is that your final answer?
"Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!"
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
"Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller."
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Good MORNING!
"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
Good morning...
"Good morning, mongrels!"
Did you know him?
Yeah.
I feel bad for his family.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
What was his name?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
What happened?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Hi... what's going on here?
"Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job."
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
I'm not following you.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Beg pardon?
Like a spear.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
A metal craft of any kind.
Like a DeLorean.
So... that's it?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Theoretically.
Donnie.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie! Give it back!
"""The Last Unicorn!"" By Samantha Darko."
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
"What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?"
I'm telling Mom.
"When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face."
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When can I squeeze one out?
Our saviour...
What did you say?
Dea ex machina...
You know what? I think that you did it.
"Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about."
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
I didn't say shit.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
How much longer is this gonna last?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Why do they call you Frank?
I am so sorry.
What happened to your eye?
Take it off. I want to see you.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
You have a request?
You have to do something for me first.
I want to show you something.
"Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?"
Where did you come from?
You'll know soon enough.
Who is... we?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Why did you make me flood the school?
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
How can you do that?
"What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!"
How old is Grandma Death?
I don't wanna talk about it.
We went to a hotel.
Yeah...
Is that a cellar door?
Who's Frank?
No. Frank.
Why? Is this about the book?
Where are we going?
Come with me.
What?
It's safe here.
"Yeah, they told me to get out of the house."
Did you call the cops?
But you're OK?
Where is she?
My mom is gone.
Hey. You OK?
Hey.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
"Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time."
Will you please talk to me?
What do you mean?
What's wrong with you?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
The whole movie. Let's go.
What? How long was I asleep?
Infant Memory Generators.
"So, we call them... IMGs."
Maybe she's asleep.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Who?
Are you okay?
They suspended me for two days.
What?
We're moving through time.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
"No... Donnie, wait. I've never..."
That's alright... I understand.
You want to kiss me...
Well...
And what?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
"With, like, images?"
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
Why?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Yeah?
Donnie?
And you'd never been there before?
"So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?"
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
"So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?"
I'm going home.
Where are you going?
Sure.
Where are we going?
Will you go with me?
That was a compliment.
I'm sorry.
You're weird.
We never would have had this conversation.
Why is that?
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Until it withers away.
Wonder where we'll be then.
You mean soap?
That's easy. Antiseptics.
What makes you think I'm not?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Wow. Did he go to jail?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
"Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?"
So... you just moved here?
Fuck them.
Don't look so freaked.
Sure.
Wanna walk me home?
School's cancelled.
Hey...
Hey...
"If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day."
People aren't that simple.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
"I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this."
It feels wonderful.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Do you get to meet Ed?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
That is a terrible nickname.
Grandma Death.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
"Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?"
When did you stop taking your medication?
You're such a fuck-ass.
"I know, Dad."
You're my only son...
Who's been giving you weird looks?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Grandma Death.
Grandma Death.
"Oh, shit!"
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Where it came from?
Know what?
Do they know yet?
So how was school today?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Cellar door.
"What's ""Cellar Door""?"
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Where are you going?
"Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?"
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
"Because the rabbits are us, Donnie."
Why should we care?
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Who is Frank?
"Goodbye, Donald."
"Goodbye, Dr. Thurman."
Thank you.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
"Where is he, Donald?"
I can see him right now!
Who is he going to kill?
Frank is going to kill.
What is going to happen?
Soon. Time is almost up.
When will this happen?
Then how is time travel possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
How is that possible?
I have the power to build a time machine.
"Where are we going, Donald?"
Where are we going?
God exists because you're horny.
Because I'm so horny.
Why?
I think now that he might...
If God exists?
You've done it again?
That I did it again.
What else makes you feel regret?
Regret.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Yes. I went to jail.
But you were punished.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt.
I... I was playing with fire.
"So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?"
Yes.
"Have you ever made love, Donald?"
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
The good stuff.
I know.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
"Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank..."
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Nothing.
What did you find?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
No. That makes you keep searching.
Do you feel alone right now?
Is Callie still around?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
How does that make you feel?
A sign from whom?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Can anyone else see him?
Four times... so far.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
"No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!"
"What about your family, Donnie?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Who is the boss?
"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
What else do you think about during school?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I asked you about school.
I think about girls a lot.
How are things going at school?
Yes.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
What is her name?
I met a girl.
"So, tell me about your day, Donald."
Yes.
No.  That's stupid.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Follow him where?
He said to follow him.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
I don't own a television.
Don't you watch the news?
How so?
I think he saved my life.
Frank.
His name is Frank.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
"So, I met a new friend."
"All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald."
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
"Okay, but it has to be a small one."
Congratulations.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
"That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it."
Her name is Gretchen.
I was just being honest.
"Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication."
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Why would I tell Mom?
"You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?"
What's her name?
Yeah.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Guess who wrote it?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."
"Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ."
"Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!"
"Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid."
Gerald.
"Excuse me? What's your name, son?"
How much are they paying you to be here?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
If that's what you think is necessary.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
I... What can we do?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Frank?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Come again?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
What I think is going on with your son.
"He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed."
He was a year ahead of us?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
What?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
You're not a bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
"Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight."
It is a big deal.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
How did you know --
You can suck a fuck.
That's enough.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Donnie? You're a dick.
Excuse me?
"I haven't been accepted yet, mother."
I guess they made him do it.
How did this happen?
Yep.
Christ. Is that an axe?
"What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else."
What else?
But now you can't go.
Beg pardon?
"Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon."
Kitty...
Rose.
"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Kitty...
"Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait..."
I stole four beers from my dad.
"We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper."
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
No more fuckin' for her.
Wicked.
Raspberry.
What is this shit?
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
There's no rule!
"You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55."
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
"Go back to China, bitch!"
Chut up!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!"
"I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!"
"Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go."
I gotta work with these women.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
"Loretta, don't do that."
"I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a..."
Airport Ho-Jo!
"All right, say ""Airport Ho-Jo."""
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
"Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber..."
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
"What? For chrissakes, spit it out."
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
"This came for you, sweetie."
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Okay.
Really?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What is wrong with you?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
"Loretta, never have kids."
"Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep."
My mom wanted me to have this?
You-betcha.
"Really, Loretta?"
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh-yah.
"""Once a carnie, always a carnie."""
"Hell-no, she ain't quittin'."
"Yeah, you betcha..."
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
"So, what do I say?"
"Oh God, I'm dead..."
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
You're what?!
"Don't let that worry you, Annette!"
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
She's right over there.
Where is she?!
"She's alive, sweetie."
Is Mom okay?
Oh-you-beccha.
Yah?
"Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't."
Your parents'd kill you.
"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"
Amber? Here.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
"Oh, Amber..."
Huh?
Mrs. Leeman?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I'm gonna need more caps.
"No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head."
Amber...
"-- red nose and ears. I know, I know."
It's okay.
We was robbed.
Bye mom.
I love you much.
C'mere. I love you so much.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
"That's it, I'm goin'..."
"Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too."
Ow!
What?!
Mom!
"Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant."
Go on! Get out!
"Oh, Mom, it's so ugly."
Oh shit!
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
"Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?"
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
"This, this... This is bullshit!"
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
"But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?"
We all do. Now let's go.
I hate her!
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Bitch!
"If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya."
"Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, ""Come and get it,"" bitch!"
I just did.
"If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it."
You heard me. Where is it?
What?
"Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary."
What're you doin' here?
"Yes, Leslie!"
"I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs."
Yes...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yeah...
"So, anyone talk to Janelle?"
"Here, have some."
"Here, I didn't get any."
Bye.
"Okay... well, bye."
"Yah-sure, fine... fine."
"So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'..."
I know.
Then it must be Wednesday.
"Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair."
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
"Here, I'll take it. It's my job."
Hi.
Hi...
They told me to practice.
"Annette, just use your hand."
Okay. Take her purse.
We was robbed.
Anyone?
"Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over."
So? Be real easy.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
I got a hairdo.
You don't know where this is gonna...
"All right, they're makin' a movie."
"They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it."
I'll be right back. See ya later.
"She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest..."
"Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta."
"Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber."
"Oh, Christ, it's true."
"Shut it up, Loretta."
"Loretta, shut it."
"Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?"
This here's Loretta.
"Oh, naw. Hi."
Hi.
Hi.
You could be quiet.
"Are we on ""Cops"" again?"
"Oh, Jesus H. Christ!"
"What do you mean, they take out her butt?"
My dress'll reek.
"Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico."
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
The bitch.
"All right, then."
Wisconsin.
What?
That bitch from...
Ohio...
Dakota.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Okay?
That's right.
I'm a mirror.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
"""U.S.A. is A-okay."""
And the year before that?
"Last year? It was, ""Buy American."""
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Yeah.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
"Girls check in, but they don't check out."
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Tammy Curry?
"Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!"
That's enough!
Becky was my only shot at state!
"So help me, Gladys."
Gladys! Stop it!
"Yeah, yeah, the Jew."
"Sammy Davis, Jr., honey."
"Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from."
Lester?
"We're not in the showroom, Dear."
"Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know."
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Enid ate a whole pan!
This is -- what?
We need more bars!
What!
"Uh, Gladys?"
"Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers."
"Okay, everybody, listen up!"
"So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview..."
Yeah.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
"""Proud... to be... an... American."""
Oh! What is it?
"All right, let's go."
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
"Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?"
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Nothin' too showy!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
"...that filth is better left in the ""Sin Cities."""
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
"You get nothing, Hank, okay?"
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Close up shop!
Harold!
"Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank."
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I will if you shut your piehole.
"Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap."
"Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head."
"Shut up, Hank. This here's business."
"Are we on ""Cops?"" Are we on ""Cops?"" Are we on ""Cops?"""
"Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University."
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
"English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!"
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
The king can do to wrong!
The king can do no wrong!
And everything.  He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
He should be king!
"Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here."
"Yes, sir."
None of your business...  Take another letter.
Who to?
Take a letter...
Father...
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
About - thirty-four seconds.
"In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?"
"Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -"
But you're my father -
His Excellency's car!
Send for my car...
"Here I am, Father..."
You do and I'll fire you.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
Is that all?
"""My dear President""..."
"""My dear""..."
"Now we're on the right track... Put back ""dear""... How does it read?"
"""My""..."
"There's still something wrong with it... take out ""President"" ...now what've you got?"
"""My President""..."
"""My dear""..."
"That doesn't sound right...  take out ""President""...  now read it."
"""My dear President""..."
My dear President...  read it back...
The President of the United States.
Who to?
Take a letter.
"Here I am, Father."
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
"He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so."
"In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?"
I wanna powder my nose...
Yes -- why?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Sure.
"So! -- He's on your side, too."
Fine.  We gotta him.
Anything else?
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
"Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning."
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
"That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men."
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
"Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?"
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
"Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men."
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
"Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?"
I can't do it...
"Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --"
You no gotta no gun.
"I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something..."
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's not bad for any day.
"I'm glad I didn't ask you for ""Washington Crossing the Delaware""."
"By the way, are you sure we need a spy?"
Send in the next girl.
You told it to me.
What did you say to her?
She did.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Then I demand an apology!
"You was insulted, but you don't know it."
Why wasn't I insulted?
My card.
"Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody."
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
What do I get?
'At's-a fine.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't wanna work at all.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
What other job you got?
"No, but I shot some ducks."
Did you shoot the rapids?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
"You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?"
"Oh no, I can't do it."
That was for you.
He only weighs ten ounces --
I don't want him.
Yankee Poodle.
What do you whistle?
"I don't call him, I whistle."
"Yeh, he's only got one eye."
Half watch dog?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Well - what is he now?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
What kind of a dog is he?
"No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --"
Have you got a license?
All right -
Hey you!!
I can't do it right away.
It must be done right away.
"That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale."
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
"How'm I doing, boss?"
"If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -"
"We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA"
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Are you sure you're not tired?
Are you getting tired?
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
"Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone..."
"Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?"
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
I still like UPSTART the best.
That's it...
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
No... it was a seven letter word.
Was it -- swine?
"No, that wasn't it..."
Oh -- you mean... worm?
I don't remember.
"What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?"
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
THEN IT'S WAR!
Bah!!
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Yes.
Then it's war?
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
You upstart!
Once more!
You worm!
Give me that again!
You swine!
That's what you think.
"Well, why not say the least and get it over with?"
"This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least..."
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
"And Vera niece, too."
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Go ahead.
"Excellency, may I present my niece."
"Your Excellency, haven't we met before?"
$50?
"Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?"
That's even a greater honor.
The king can do no wrong!
But -
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
"I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War."
WHAT  ?
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
"Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened."
Take a seat -- you're next.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Why -- why -- of course.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
"Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet."
Now -- er --
"Oh, won't you reconsider..."
Let him patch up his own breeches...
"Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say."
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
"Oh, Rufus!"
"Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg..."
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Your Excellency!
What'll I do with this card?
"For you, I would do anything..."
"Oh, would you...?"
This is terrible!
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
"What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything."
Perhaps he will listen to you...
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
I thought everything was working out fine.
"This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool..."
"Uncle, you can't do this!"
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
So that's the one you want to marry.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
"Oh, yes."
I've always thought that myself.
They have noble faces.
How lovely.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh?
"Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room."
"Two, please."
One or two?
"Yes please, two."
"Mr. Merrick, sugar?"
Oh Frederick.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
"Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?"
That I am very little different from him.
"Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?"
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Hmmm?
More romances for John?
"Dinner will be served, shortly, dear."
You stay with me.
And here are my mother and father.
Yes.
Do you?
John loves the house.
"Well, these things take time."
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
"I'm sure I don't know, Freddie."
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
"Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?"
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
What do you mean?
"Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged."
"No, I think a whiskey."
"Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?"
"Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?"
"Did it go well, darling?"
I'll join you shortly.
You won't be long?
I'll get my bag.
Like this.
What is it?
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Did you see it?
I found it.
Yes?
"Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir."
Shut up!
Don't!
I'll show you! I'll show you!
What are you going to do?
"He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die."
"Aw, Bytes, he's sick."
"You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!"
Right... Right.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
"I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!"
I want him back!
You don't own this man!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
"Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!"
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
"Never mind that, I want my man!"
"Just a moment, how did you get in here?"
I want my man back.
Everything will be seen to.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
This man belongs in hospital.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
He must have taken quite a fall.
He fell.  He falls.
What happened?
I intend to.
"He was fine when he left here, and now look at him."
What do you mean?
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
"Steady on, Treves. Have a seat."
Please do.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Has the response picked up?
"Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?"
Don't we?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
"Well, yes."
I could easily arrange...
"No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can."
"Yes, I think I can."
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
"Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness."
Treves. Well done.
"Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?"
I don't understand.
"And what was that, John?"
Oh yes?
"Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?"
"...Yes, Sir."
"Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir."
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
"Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee."
"Well sir, perhaps I should explain..."
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Good! How is the patient?
"Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning."
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
"Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?"
"No, more of an acquaintance."
"Oh, is he a friend of yours?"
"Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional."
Yes sir.
"Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?"
"No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten."
Indeed!
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
"It's quite nutritious, sir."
You've acquired a taste for this?
"Good morning, sir."
"Good morning, Treves."
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
I am very pleased to meet you.
"It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick."
"What is it, Treves?"
...everyone has been very kind.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Are you comfortable here?
I feel much better. Thank you.
"I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?"
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
How are you feeling today?
You never mentioned his mental state.
"Nothing of any importance, eh?"
I don't know what I've got.
"Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there."
"Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?"
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
"I say Freddie, what are you about?"
What a mess.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Three quarters of an hour.
How long has this man been here?
"Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits."
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
"An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel."
"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Oh no?
"Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all..."
"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"No, but I certainly shall."
Have you read it?
Romance!
"Tell me about it, please!"
"Alas, no."
You've never been?
"Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?"
"Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there."
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Yes.
"She's very pretty, your mother."
I knew you'd understand. Here.
"Oh, no."
Good day...!
Yes.
"Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite..."
Is he... dying then?
"And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain."
How awful for John.
"Good day, Mr. Merrick."
"You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction."
"Oh, yes."
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
"Oh no, my friend..."
Won't be a moment.
Yes.
Of course! You want out?
You're English.
Want to come out?
y-y-yes--
You alright?
"Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick."
I'll have to find some more.
...I learned a long time ago.
The main spire.
What's this?
"The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!"
Where did you get this box?
Thank you... very much.
"But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good."
Yes.
Good morning.
"Good morning, Mr. Merrick."
"No, nothing."
"Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now."
Thank you very much.
Yes.
"Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?"
"You too, my friend. Goodnight."
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
"No, no, I wouldn't change a thing."
Then I shouldn't change anything?
"No, John, not one that I can see."
Yes John?
"I'm glad, John. Goodnight."
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
"Yes, very soon."
"Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?"
"Oh no, I couldn't."
"Stand up, John. Let them see you."
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
"Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves."
Is it the one you wanted?
"There is one more thing, John. Here."
My home.
Yes.
You did this for me?
"Yes, John."
...my... home?
"You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?"
"You want a dressing bag, John?"
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
I thought as much.
...Can you cure me?
"Yes, John?"
Good morning.
"Good morning, John."
Here.
Your mother?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
"Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice."
"Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends."
The Children. Where are your children
Of course.
The children! May I see?
"Oh, our relatives... the children."
Who are they of?
Oh yes.
"Not at all, John."
"How is your tea, John?"
Ohhh...
"That's a canopy, John."
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
"When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best."
Thank you very much.
"You look splendid, John."
How long will I stay here?
Of course! What did you think?
The hospital?
Yes.
This... is my new home?
"Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?"
Good evening. How are you feeling?
"We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?"
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
You did not ask me.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
...Yes potatoes... but...
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
"John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm."
"Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!"
Righteousness for his namesake.
Righteousness...
"Hello, my name is John Merrick."
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
Mmmerrick.
"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
Mmmerrick.
"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
Merrick...
"Say ""Merrick""."
John... Merrick
John Merrick.
My... name is...
My name is...
Hello...
"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""
Yes.
Yes!
"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
Yyess.
Yyyess.
...Yyes
Yes John!
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
"Welcome home, John."
Well...
"You don't think it's too gaudy, do you."
A dressing bag?
Yes. John wants it.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag.
Yes sir.  What's that?
"Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office."
"Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick."
"I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir."
"Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue."
"Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you."
Watery headed bunch.
"Good Lord, Mr. Treves!"
"Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it."
"No, he's very upset about something."
"Won't come out, eh?"
"Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning."
"Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?"
Yes! The workhouse!
The workhouse.
"Yes... Yes, let's go in."
I've heard.
Fine.
"Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?"
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
"YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?"
"When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound."
HE'S GONE!
"I... I don't know what you mean, Sir."
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
"So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?"
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Pardon me?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
"I don't think so. No sir, we're closed."
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
"And who might you be, sir?"
Are you the proprietor?
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
"But, Father, it IS!"
It's all right! It isn't happening!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
It's your fantasy...
"There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic..."
You're losing your temper!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
"There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself."
Well... where is he?
There IS no one.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
"Who, Father?"
Right! Where is he?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
"But, Aud... I... I came to find someone..."
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
No... no...
Then I shall come too.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Not quite...
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
The second note to wake the Gods...
The second note.
Then let go!
Yes -- I believe you do.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
I... but I...
Do you believe I love you?
Of course.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
That's right!
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
"Goodbye, Aud..."
But you don't realize....
Erik. You don't understand.
I'll bring it back.
No!
Why?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
"I mean, you could have killed yourself."
Just give me a hand.
"But, Erik..."
Halfdan the Black.
Who?
We mustn't let him land!
And the week before that?
You're as bad as my father.
Five this week; how many the week before?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
And I thought you said it was something special...
"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
"""The fifth one this week""!"
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
I've never LOVED anybody!
"You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?"
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
We never went to bed together.
But you LOVED her all the same...
"Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well..."
What was she like?
It was different...
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
"No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?"
"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
But surely you know...?
Yes.
WHY?
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
What?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What's the matter?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Those things in your hands.
What are what?
Please! Please! What are those?
"Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil."
"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"
"Well, of course. We always welcome friends."
WELCOME?
I said welcome.
WHAT did you say?
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
How do we know this is the way?
What d'you mean?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
It was my master Keitel's idea.
But --
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
That I cannot tell you.
"And will the dead ever return, Freya?"
I will go and wake them up!
"The Gods are asleep, Erik."
Is there nothing men can do?
"The sky WAS blue, Erik... once."
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
"Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?"
"Is it summer or winter, Erik?"
"It is day, of course, Freya."
"Is it night or day, Erik?"
I see the world.
"What do you see, Erik?"
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
I shouldn't have come.
"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"
The important thing is not to panic.
But it IS! Look!
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
"Yes... oh, yes..."
Is there something the matter with it?
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
He wants to kill US!
Don't talk nonsense.
"Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!"
Why?
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
You've got to let me go!
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Yes?
I'll tell you what...
"YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing..."
"The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf."
"Well, how d'you think I feel?"
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
No.
"No, no... It was very... er, nice."
We're just not a very musical nation...
"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
No.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Really.
REALLY?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
You're just saying that.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
But you don't want to hear it.
I'm sure it's lovely.
A lot of people like our singing.
"Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is..."
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
"What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?"
"That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're..."
Would you like us to sing to you?
Well... isn't it great?
"Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing."
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
How?
No... we don't...
I don't know! I just did!
Why should you care?
Odin!
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Is THAT Odin?
Well... no...
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Why?
What a stupid idea.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Tell me your name?
Why... should YOU care?
Why should you care?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
You told them I raped you -- why?
"Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts..."
I didn't mean to!
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
"Oh, thanks."
Aaagh! Rape!
Louder.
Ah.
Scream.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Well you started it.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
"To pay for the next expedition, of course."
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
"What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?"
"Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all."
"You DON'T like it, do you?"
About NOT raping you...
About raping me?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What?
I don't suppose... no...
"Oh, get it over with."
"No. It isn't rape then, is it?"
What -- rape?
You don't love ME.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Sh!
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Shut up.
What about the raping?
Yes.
"Looting and pillaging, eh?"
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Don't you FEEL it?
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
I know. I know.
"But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!"
He wants to KILL us.
I know!
Halfdan the Black's here!
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
That's terrible!
What's wrong with making friends?
No.
Let's hack her to pieces.
Very deep... usually...
How deep IS the ocean?
It saved my father!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It's Halfdan the Black!
"Come on, move it!"
What are you talking about?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What?
But...
"""But"" what?"
Find it... AND cross it!
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
That's my boy!
I... I... KILLED her...
So? What'd you do to her?
She got me thinking...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I met this girl...
Who have you been talking to?
"Where does it all get us, Grandpa?"
"You talking piffle, son?"
"We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet..."
What?
What's it all about?
We're missing all the fun...
Make your mind up.
Faster!
Sorry!
Slower! In... Out...
Sorry.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Row! Row! Row!
"I want to die...  No, I don't!"
"Well, you ARE!"
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Look out!
What did he say?
You'll see!
"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"
"What ""magic""?"
It's magic.
The sun! That's it!
"Look, the sky is blue..."
ROW!
SHUT UP!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You may need a real Berserk.
What are YOU doing here?
Look... Erik...
But you're the Gods!
So?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Why should WE care?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
You must help us.
No! Arrgh!
You'll be sucked down too!
I've got you!
"No! Let go, Snorri!"
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
Weren't we supposed to?
To the oars!
A magic dishcloth.
Like fish.
"Well, come on!"
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Row!
That's better.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
"That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there."
Trust me to get the missionary.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Now stop it!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
You mean we'd be dead?
"No, don't say anything else!"
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
I think we should go...
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Just say something cheerful.
What's the matter with them?
Oh... er... yes...
You need to say a bit more than that!
Nobody gets killed.
Who gets killed?
There is another way.
What are you talking about?
"Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!"
What is it?
How about making friends?
"Well, what else do we do?"
But...
"And you, Keitel Blacksmith."
But how could he know... unless...
What do you think?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Keitel Blacksmith?
"Wait, Erik!"
I have to go...
I came to find my grandfather.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Sven!
Over the Edge of the World.
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Hy-Brasil?
She MUST have a knife or something...
She hasn't got any.
DEATH!
ROW!
We haven't got a spare place.
"I AM one, Dad!"
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
"Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?"
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
"Look, I bagged it last week."
I was sitting there.
"Hey, you two! What's going on?"
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
But HOW?
We'd be the first!
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
"Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik."
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
"What are you talking about, Erik?"
I will join my grandfather there.
"And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?"
Please.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What d'you expect me to do?
You will wait?
Yeah... well...
Bye... sorry...
"Bye, Leif."
"Well, where is he then?"
He hasn't.
Vanish into thin air?
Do what?
How did he do that?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
What do we have to do?
It can't do you any HARM...
The Dragon...
What's all the panic about?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
Your lord.
"You know, my son, our lord said..."
"No, it is NOT."
"Same thing, isn't it?"
"Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian."
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You're wasting your time.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Mum! Dad!
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
"Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!"
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
That's it!
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Bastard.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
I know. I know.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
"You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know."
"No, I'm not."
Are you all right?
Hang on...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
"I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too..."
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What are you talking about?
"Let me go, Sven."
Got you!
Aaagh!
What have you got there?
"Get away, Snorri."
"What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?"
What?
Oh...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
Who's that?
I... I...
Well! Come on!
It's not my business any more!
"Made by YOU, Loki!"
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
You fool!
You've lost your mind.
"No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!"
"Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!"
She knows it was our fault!
Shut up!
Help!
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
"Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!"
I'm drowning! Help!
Relax!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
YOU do it!
Sh! Hurry!
How can we stops him now?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Well... I... I thought...
"Wasn't it, Keitel?"
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Together we stand!
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
That's right.
My brother blacksmiths!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Can't make enough swords!
"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
"Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says..."
You could charge him what you like.
"Yes, it is good. But I told him ten."
"Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one."
I hate you! I hate you!
Dad!
"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
"Easy, Dad!"
He drove me mad!
Helpless...
There is nothing we can do...
"GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!"
"Well, go on! Go berserk!"
"I'm just building up to it, Dad."
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Sh!
"Well, of course he is!"
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Stop it!
KILL! KILL!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
I must KILL! Kill!
"Not now, Sven..."
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I must only let the red rage...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
But it's a responsibility...
So did my father and his father before him.
So did your father...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
You went berserk...
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
"I know, Dad."
It's a tradition.
Tell him I'm coming!
No... he's not... not... there...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Thorfinn! You can't die!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Shut up.
Me too.
Well... I'm game.
Neither am I.
"Well I'M certainly not, either."
You liar!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
I never do...
"Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad."
And keep your sword greased.
"No, Mother."
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
"Yes, Mum."
And something to sharpen them with?
"Yes, Mother."
And you've got BOTH axes?
No one.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
I told you that later.
"Yeah, you told me that later."
I remember.
"I did. You said, things were fine."
"Just a little overworked, maybe."
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Say hi to Naomi.
Yeah.
"I hope you feel better, sweetie."
"Thanks, guys."
"Sweetie, we called the company."
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
"I don't know, honey. It's horrible."
"Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?"
"No, it was lovely."
You did? You liked me?
And I just liked you so much.
"Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car..."
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Here we are.
"Okay, I guess."
How are you today?
Hi.
Ms. Kruczynski?
"Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you."
"Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski."
May I help you?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
What's wrong with me?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
"Um, okay. I'll call my study partner."
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Come up to Boston with me?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
"Oh, Tangerine."
"Oh, baby, what's going on?"
In the world.
In the room?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
"I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow."
You rat.
"I can't. I want to, but I have to study."
Come over after I'm done here?
I was not.
You were not.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
"Okay, I guess."
How are you today?
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I can't stop thinking about you.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Doesn't sound like me.
I don't know.
"Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious."
A bully? Moi?
Says you were a bully...
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
"Well, you obviously don't know me."
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
"I'm nervous, too."
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
"Hey, Joel --"
That's okay. I --
"Oh, um..."
Have sex. Y'know --
Make love?
"Listen, did you want to make love?"
"Joel, come here. Please."
I think I should go back.
What if?
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I don't know.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Yeah.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Tomorrow?
When?
Yeah.
"So you'll call me, right?"
I love you.
"Bye, Joel."
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
What if you stay this time?
So go.
I think we should go.
"Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet."
Naomi.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
It's dark.
I knew.
"I could see you wanted to come in, Joel."
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing?
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Female.
Male or female?
Oh.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
"Um, no."
I wish we did. You married?
"Yeah, maybe."
Seems too coincidental that way.
"I think, before."
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Me too. There's this poem --
I think she's great.
I love her.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Okay.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
yeah?
I don't think I've slept in a year.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
What do we do?
I know.
"This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon."
"Yeah, like that."
I'm Joel.
"Oh God, how horrid."
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You said --
"Yeah, I know. I'm fishing."
You know what I did.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You said...
Hi.
Hi there.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
"It would be different, if we could just give it another go around."
I know.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Probably.
You had the whole human race pegged.
"I had you pegged, didn't I?"
I remember that speech really well.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Okay.
Not yet. Not married.
"Well, you're married."
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Yeah?
I did it. I guess that means something.
Is that what you want?
I told her today I need to end it.
"Yes, exactly. Exactly my point."
It's very late.
Come up and see me... now.
I dropped you off after. You said --
And I didn't have an argument.
"So what. Infatuation is good, too."
But you weren't. I could tell.
"I'm sure, I said."
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
We did talk about Naomi.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Right. Something black though.
"No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons."
"Egad, were you horrified?"
What was I wearing?
Yeah.
"Naomi, I guess."
Do you remember what we talked about?
"This is our first ""date"" date."
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Yeah.
I love it!
I scoured the city for it.
"Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!"
Happy Birthday.
Joel!
"This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me."
"Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?"
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
"Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally."
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
"But can't you see... I love you, Antoine."
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Really? Is he cute?
What?
There's this guy!
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
You remember what happened next?
"Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden."
I'm right here.
"I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem."
What do you mean?
What if you hide me?
I don't know.
"Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?"
Oh?
"Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!"
Such a beautiful view.
No.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
"Yeah, Tangerine?"
Joely...
No. Thanks.
More?
"Joel, you're a liar."
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I want to know you.
"No, it isn't that."
"You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --"
You're drunk.
"Would you get me another, Joely?"
"So, um --"
"Oh, thank God. It's going."
"Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --"
"Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!"
I don't want to talk about this here.
What?!
"Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?"
You're not ready.
I don't think we're ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
I want to have a baby.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Where are you going?
How can you watch this crap?
"Fuck you, Joel. Faggot."
Let me drive you home.
"I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody."
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
It's three.
Yo ho ho!
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Okay.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Tomorrow?
When?
Yeah.
"You'll call me, right?"
"So, I enjoyed meeting you."
Yes.
Okay.
"I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so..."
You should stay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
"Yeah? Oh, great!"
Okay.
I think so.
That's scary sounding.
"Oh, yeah."
"No, not at all."
No.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yeah.
Thanks.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I think about that.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know."
I don't know.
Yeah?
"Y'know, I'm sort of psychic."
"Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant."
Thanks.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No. I --
"No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?"
"Well, I should probably get going."
You just say. I'm not really --
You pick it.
What do you want to hear?
"No, I'm okay for now."
Ready for another?
"Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway."
I'm fine.
"God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off."
Cheers.
It's pretty.
Frost?
I don't know.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
"Thanks. That was good, that crow sound."
Very much.
You like that?
"Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel."
Um --
Take care.
"Well, I wouldn't want to be --"
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
What?
"Sort of, um..."
"Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way."
I like to read.
"So you like bookstores, huh?"
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
"Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really."
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah.
You know Wilmont?
I'm not a stalker.
"Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no."
"You're not a stalker or anything, right?"
Where do you live?
Yeah?
It's okay.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You're sure? It's cold.
"No, that's okay. Thanks, though."
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Probably see you at the book store.
"Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then."
"It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --"
That's okay.
Yes?
"Joel? It's Joel, right?"
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Okay.
"Well, anyway... Sorry."
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
"See, I wouldn't think that about you."
"Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told."
"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"
"Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?"
I'm not nuts.
"Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?"
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm Joel.
"My name's Clementine, by the way."
"Yeah, I got it."
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
"Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?"
"Oh, I doubt that's the case."
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I'm sure you would.
"Purple Haze, Pink Eraser."
I don't really know how --
I can't remember.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I like it.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I don't have one.
"Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now."
Really? Because --
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Rockville Center.
"It's okay, really."
"No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --"
Oh. So...
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
"Well, I didn't want to assume."
Really?
"No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so..."
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why what?
Why?
I'm sorry.
Jesus.
Your dried cum.
I don't know. Panties and --
Guess what I'm wearing.
You must have been crazy.
"God, I can't believe I ever hated you."
"Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?"
"Hi, it's Joel."
"Look, I have to go. I have to think."
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
It's true.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Yeah?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I guess so.
"Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married."
"Oddly enough, I do."
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I just walked in.
What took you so long?
That's me.
Long day thinking.
I just got in.
"Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?"
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
How's it going?
Hi.
"Hi, Naomi, it's Joel."
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Clementine.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
"This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over."
Okay. I wish you could come.
Naomi.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
She's so sexy.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
How's the chicken?
And what are you like? A wino?
"Any messages, Carmen?"
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
So then she just stops calling.
That's your look for me.
Clementine.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I should maybe talk to you.
It's too late.
It's them.
"Fuck you, Clementine."
I might be making a mistake.
I'm like a joke to them.
"The driver waved. So casual, friendly."
It was snowing.
What? What do you mean?
You have to stop this!
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Well... I did.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
'Night.
We'll speak soon.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
"Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right."
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I'm glad you called.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh! Great. That's great!
"Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while."
I miss you.
"Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Yeah.
I hope you get your work done.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
So you don't mind?
In a minute.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Go back to sleep.
"Hi, Rob and Carrie."
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
How was it?
Hi.
Hi.
It's not somebody else.
"No. I just need some space, maybe."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""
What?
"So what's going on, Joel?"
"Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really."
You take it. I don't know.
Yours?
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely!
"I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things."
Very cool. Trippy.
"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""
Yeah. Cool.
"Nah, I don't know."
"Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?"
"Hi, Mary. How's it going?"
"Oh, hey, Patrick."
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
"Mary, people come to him voluntarily."
Then why did you ask me?
I know what it is.
Nothing.
What's this?
Can I... I brought some --
"What do you want, Stan?"
Hi.
Oh.
"Thanks, Stan."
"I really like you, Mary. You know that."
And after that?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
How did I look?
"Once, maybe."
I swear.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hey.
Hell no.
You better go.
He's coming?
"This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan."
No way. I can handle this.
Shit!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
I don't know! I just said that!
"Well, what should we do?"
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Where?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
"Listen, it's not erasing."
What?
It's stopped.
"You love him, don't you?"
Yeah.
"It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world."
Go.
"Let him go, Stan. I can help."
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
It's a good one all right.
"Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate."
That's a good one.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
We haven't checked.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
You found us okay?
It's freezing out.
"I better do this, Stan."
"Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --"
'kay.
"See you later, alligator."
"Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here."
I know. Anyway --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Sorry. I just --
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
Boo.
It was a mutual decision.
You made me have an abortion.
"I have a family, Mary."
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
"What, Howard?"
"No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard."
We can't do this.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
"I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that."
"It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it."
That's lovely.
You are such a sweetheart.
It's no big deal.
Alexander Pope?
"There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander."
"It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it."
Is that Nietzsche?
"Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some."
How do you mean?
"Do you like quotes, Howard?"
"Well, thank you, Mary."
"That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist."
"Okay, we're back in."
"Welcome, Howard."
Thanks.
"Cole slaw, ice tea?"
Order me a pastrami for after?
Yes?
Mary...
"Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in."
"Howard, your one o'clock."
"1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center."
"Jesus. All right, what's the address."
He went home sick.
"Well, where was Patrick?"
"Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?"
Stan? What's going on?
Jesus.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Howard."
"Thanks, Stan. Thanks."
"So, I've got to drop the van off."
"That's fine, Stan."
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Oh dear.
"Howard, they've disappeared again."
"Yeah, probably a good idea."
"You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here."
Yeah. Of course.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
I tried that already.
"She came to help, Howard."
Mary. What are you doing here?
"Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable."
Maybe after the holidays then.
Of course. Please have a seat.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
"Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --"
"Oh, hi."
"Thanks, Stan. I owe you."
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
"Patrick, we're in the middle of --"
It's a quote book.
What's your bartlett's?
"Okay, There's more, Stan --"
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
"Jesus, Patrick!"
"She was unconscious, Patrick."
"Patrick, we need to focus."
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
This one's history. Moving on...
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
You can if you want.
She likes you okay.
Just wanted to let you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's an apartment.
"Yeah, that looks better. Thanks."
Does that help?
Then check the connections.
The voltage looks fine.
That's your problem.
"Easy come, easy go."
You mean she's dead?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
"Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better."
Is everything getting worse?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
"Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?"
The Clock People?
"Siwash, huh?"
Clockworks?
Clockworks.
What was that?
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
But I don't know how to polka.
Save your breath for the climb.
I know who you are.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
"Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home."
Where are the others?
"You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling."
"A traveler, eh?"
"Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving."
You don't?
I don't.
"I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?"
I'm staying with the Countess.
"Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?"
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
"No, I guess not."
"How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?"
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
That's Jellybean!
"You don't agree with Debbie, then?"
What is Debbie's position?
"You're political, then?"
About...
Tell me about it.
What guy?
"Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake."
"I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault."
Whose fault was that?
"Oh, we didn't get it all the way on."
Well.... er...
What do you think?
Like what?
How does she like what in bed?
"Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?"
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Extraordinary!
Why? Why do you have to go?
"I have to go, Julian."
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
What are you doing?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I'm cold.
Whooee!
You're the best?
I'm the best.
Hitchhiking?
Yep.
So now you're bummin' around?
For magazines?
I was a successful model once.
Are you in show business?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Thanks.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
Going north?
I don't know anything about it.
"Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman."
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
But Countess...
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
A job for me?
Your ranch?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
A born freak can only go uphill.
Tired...
I think I found something...
Justin?
Holy shit...
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
"Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here."
...do you copy?
"So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?"
I can see why they sent you along.
I heard it.
"That means top-secret, Cooper."
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Ballast.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Will it work?
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
On my way.
"Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark."
I'll get him.
But Justin...
"Hold on, Coop..."
"The containment, Second Containment..."
"Coop, where are you..."
We have a man down...
I'll be all over it.
"...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on..."
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
From what?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
"This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?"
"You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that..."
"Don't start with me, Cooper."
Time to play Spam in the can.
Roger that.
"Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in."
"Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith..."
"We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole."
It's holding... She's holding...!
What about the accumulator...?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
"Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me."
What?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
"I'm telling you, I saw it..."
I don't know what happened to Justin.
You weren't there. I saw it.
"No, he didn't."
"Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?"
"No, thank you."
Coffee.
What?
"Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?"
Run!
What...?
Hurry.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
"I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert..."
Can you shut it down?
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
How? The Bridge is gone.
"You're okay now, it's over..."
"Let me breathe, let me breathe..."
"I don't know, the screens are dead...!"
What's happening?
It is not.
Is that an offer?
Oh God...
Please... kill...
"Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I..."
Please...
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
What happened?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Hear what?
Do you hear it? Right there.
It gets worse.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Go on.
What is it?
No.
"""Another man?"" Who?"
We'll make it.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
"I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers."
"Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement..."
How is he?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Trauma.
"He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ..."
His peritoneum has ruptured...
"Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood..."
He's crashing...
90 over 50 and falling... .
Pressure?
"I've got a pulse, he's alive..."
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
What's wrong?
A power drain --
What's happening...?
Nothing. It's nothing.
What's wrong?
"Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors."
Thank you.
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
"You wanted to see me, Admiral?"
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Some things you don't get over.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What's on your mind?
Does he know that?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
"It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir."
Starck!
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
From the Other Place...
"""The dark inside...""? I don't understand."
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
The dark inside me.
What does?
"It won't stop, it goes on and on and on..."
"What, Justin, what shows you?"
I'm going in.
"That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering."
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
I built it.
How do you know all this?
Justin. I won't let you die.
"But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please..."
...I don't want to die...!
"Skipper, you gotta help me..."
Justin.
Patch me through to him.
"Almost done, I just gotta check one thing..."
"Justin, finish your sweep."
"Yes, sir!"
Start the countdown.
"Everything green on my boards, Skipper."
"Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship."
The crew? Could they still be alive?
"Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures."
"Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible."
This is Weir.
Thanks.
Justin.
"That's a negative, Starck."
Do it.
"Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan..."
"I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin..."
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
...you okay?
Peters...
Skipper...
Can anybody hear me...
Crystallized.
...how's the client?
"Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters..."
Frozen.
Alive?
I found one.
"What you got, Peters?"
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
"There's no one here, Skipper."
"The blood came from somewhere, Peters..."
"Starck, you still showing those readings?"
I can see the hatch.
"I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing..."
"Peters is right, no one's here."
"So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?"
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Jesus its huge.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
We've got pressure.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
What's the hold up?
NOOO!
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Starck... Cooper...
You're lying...!
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Better if I just show you.
"Then what, what are you? Tell me..."
I'm not the Devil.
"You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!"
You know.
What are you?
"Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?"
Then who the fuck are you?
Weir is dead.
What makes you think I'll miss?
"If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too."
What are you talking about?
Your eyes...
Son of a bitch!
I told you... She won't let you leave...
You can't leave. She won't let you.
Watch me.
You... You can't do that!
What about my ship?
It's done.
Don't... don't do this...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
"You can't, your orders are specific..."
We're leaving.
"That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor."
"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Yes...
You said this ship creates a gateway...
What do you want me to say?
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Do it.
"We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad."
The Core...!
I don't know.
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
It's 2041...
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
What about it?
The date.
"You have something, Dr. Weir?"
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
"If it worked, yes."
If it worked.
It's insane.
It's complicated...
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""
Yes.
"It beats dying, Mister Smith."
"They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward."
No one?
Negative.
Any survivors?
"Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead."
"Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep."
"I can see that, what're they for?"
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
That is not acceptable --
"Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --"
"Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge."
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
"Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster."
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
What does it say?
That's what we're here to find out.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
"Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way."
"Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity..."
"Captain Miller, I just want to say..."
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
"Where is it, where is it..."
Get out of there now!
"No, no, we just got her back together..."
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
"Come again, Skipper?"
"Smith, get out of there..."
"I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark."
"What is it, Smith?"
Skipper...
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Now what?
"Captain, we got a problem."
Thank you.
"Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly."
Sir.
That's enough!
Understood.
"We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air."
"I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?"
"Captain Miller, you copy?"
"You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?"
But...
They're gone.
"No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?"
We don't have time to fart.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
We have a situation here...
"Smith, where the hell have you been?!"
Captain Miller...
"Starck, give me a read."
It is now.  We're locked in.
Love to.
"Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?"
Starck...
Where is it?
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
"I noticed. Starck, anybody home?"
We've got some weather.
Dr. Weir...!
"Yes, sir."
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
"Something like that, yeah."
"We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out..."
"Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening..."
One-four degrees...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Heading three-three-four...
What is that?
Jesus...
Locked and cocked.
He's dead...
Weir.
"Miller, he's back, he was in the tank..."
"...repeat, we're armed..."
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
No. I'll be right back.
I'll do it --
Blow it up?
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
"We've got to shut it down, we've got to..."
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Weir can't be alive.
Five seconds.
"You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door."
"I'm on my way, Starck."
Stay here! Don't stop working!
"He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit."
What?
Justin's in the airlock.
"What's going on in there, Starck?"
"Miller, come in..."
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
"If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?"
I know that.
"Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible."
"It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports..."
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
You've got to listen...
Go ahead.
I've got a theory.
"""...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,"" don't you have anything useful to tell me?"
"What is it, Starck?"
Miller...
"Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something..."
Who?
No. It was someone else.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
"I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins."
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew."
What's causing the readings?
What about the life readings you picked up?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Carbon dioxide?
Oxygen is not the problem.
How much oh-two do we have?
But you can breathe it.
It tastes bad.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
We're all here.
Everybody okay?
Keep your eyes open.
That's an affirmative.
Radiation interference?
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Come around to three-three-four...
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
I just finished drying...
"Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?"
Let's go.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Justin?
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
I did.
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one here.
Can you see a body?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
"Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?"
"You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?"
"Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?"
They're explosive charges.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Claire...
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
He served on the Goliath.
He's been past Mars?
Yes.
First time in a grav couch?
I don't care.
It's cold.
You got any coffee?
"Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay..."
"We have to do something, oh God..."
"Come on, Baby-bear, open this door..."
Almost got it.
Do you know what it was?
Keep him talking.
"Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it."
Can you shut it down?
He's engaged the override.
Not according to the computer.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
"Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith."
What?
We're losing atmosphere...
The safety circuit's failed!
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
What the hell is that?
"Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber..."
She's not ugly.
"Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker..."
"Dead ahead, 5000 meters."
Where is she?
Hey...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
"I'm trying, goddammit --"
Get them back --
"Miller, do you read me, Peters --"
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Explosive decompression.
What happened to his eyes?
Picking up magnetic interference.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
1000 meters...
"The scope is lit, it's right in front of us..."
Range 3000 meters and closing.
"If they are, they're screening their calls."
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
You can't do that.
"All boards are green, everything's five by five."
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
It means nothing.
"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"
"Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?"
The forward airlock.
What is it?
I'm alright. Please.
"In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset."
It wants me. I have to go.
What are you doing?
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
I'm sorry.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
"It must be hard, being so far away from her."
Yes.
Claire is your wife?
"Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love."
I can't believe we built this.
I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
What is it?
Ship's log.
What is it?
Do they have pressure?
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
A straight line.
How?
I like the sound of that.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Those yours too?
"No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty..."
"Relax, it's casual."
I'm not really dressed for a party.
"I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?"
How'd you know it was me?
"Trust me, this ain't one of those times."
"Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing."
"You wouldn't say that, if you could see me."
I don't think She's real big on hate.
I mean...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
"""Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."""
"You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals."
Victor must've taken him.
Where is Reed?
It's easy for you to be patient.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What did he do to the uniform?!
"Oh, he did."
He didn't.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
You look like an eighties rock band.
"We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped."
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Is it safe?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
And you can? Power it up?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
"What do you want, Vic?"
Where do you think? With Sue.
What is this? Where's Reed?
"Ben, come in."
About me? How sweet.
I'm worried about you.
What are you doing here?
I already got it. Everything I want.
"What did you wish for, honey?"
"Deb, it's me. It's still me."
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
"Baby, you're scaring me."
Ben?
"Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you."
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
"Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock."
"Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom."
I'll be watching over you.
"Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is."
"Got it, teach."
"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben --
"This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again."
It's about to be a broken face.
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
"Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --"
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
You got a chisel round here?
"Yeah, nine years straight."
We had a tough year.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Ben. Are you okay?
What the --!
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Are you alright?
Well maybe you should date him.
"He's smart, powerful, successful --"
"I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?"
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
"Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie."
"Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --"
"I should have done more, run more tests --"
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Solid.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
How long was I out?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
"I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead."
Should?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Victor's better at these things.
"This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there."
He's made a few changes.
Isn't that your speech?
This makes five.
I had it at four.
Five times.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
"Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --"
"Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives."
What about his first born?
Ben. This is business. Just work.
I can't take this.
You'd never know it.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
"Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through."
No more cracks about how I look.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Go back to the drawing board.
Hey! That's a prototype!
Give me the god damn mirror!
"They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --"
Give me a mirror...
What's wrong with me?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Reed?... Sue?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Where... where am I?
"Don't you wander off, boy."
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
"Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either."
"Yeah, well, his eyes say different."
'Course not. Strictly business.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
"Keep talking, there won't be a next time."
"If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive."
That's terrible news...
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
What?
"What do you mean ""complete""?"
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
And they're changing into...
No: You're ON FIRE!
Not this again --
You're on fire!
Last one down springs for room service.
I though we went over this.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Me like-y.
"My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --"
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
"I mean, you feel a little feverish."
So are you!
You're hot!
And where do we think we're going?
Now.
But all these people...
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
You need to control yourself and think before you --
"Right, whatever, have fun."
They're not costumes.
"Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --"
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
I can go hotter!
"Back it down, Johnny!"
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
"Oh, it is."
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You've been working out.
This is wrong in so many ways.
"Ben, are you there?"
"Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!"
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Now what is up with that?
Ben! Ben!
He's not responsive --
What about you?
"Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields."
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
What are you doing --
"No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out."
"I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --"
"Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --"
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Blockhead started it!
You two need a time-out.
"You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!"
Dude. That's my sister.
I'm driving.
Girl...?!
"Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl."
That's the temperature of the sun.
Sweet.
"You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --"
You're really cramping my style here.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I think that thing is Ben.
What is that thing?
"Okay, ""mom."""
Stop it.
Johnny.
"Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --"
Please tell me you go silent too.
Apparently I can disappear.
"Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!"
"Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington."
Front page?
"Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing..."
"You know, maybe you should get some rest --"
And that's a good thing?
"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
"Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --"
How's the IPO?
"Recording, sir. We see you perfectly."
"Leonard, how's the feed?"
"History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?"
Then what is it?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Showtime.
"They're ready for you, sir."
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
And if he's not...?
"If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering."
"A gasket? Reed, we're at a party."
"I found a broken gasket, from space --"
I'm sure I can come up with something.
"Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --"
You need a doctor.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
"Reed, stop, you need to rest your --"
I can... make it work.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Why didn't you say something?
"I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man."
I gave him twenty.
"You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?"
You were?
"Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous."
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
"Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --"
"He was going to take away all my data, equipment --"
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
"No way to know. Without more tests, experiments."
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Of course. Of course.
"But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?"
"Curing countless diseases, not just ours."
And reverse the mutations --
What are you doing?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
"Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked."
"No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo..."
Are you kidding?
"I mean, you broke up with me, right?"
What in the world would give me that idea?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Excuse me?
"If it happened to him, then it could..."
That's what we're here to find out.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  Oh.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
We need to get past them.
What?
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue... look at your hands.
What? What do you mean you --
"Uh, Sue...? I can't."
For science.
Passion.
Which was?
You're happy for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
That's good. That's uh... good.
"Yes, thanks."
Feeling better?
Great minds think alike.
"As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --"
It's been changed.
"I, uh, think I remember the number."
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I was talking about us. Working together.
Never better.
"You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--"
But I'm not done with the machine --
What are you doing here?
"Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --"
"I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --"
Ben did this?
Ben did this.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Not until Ben is back inside!
"Reed, we're running out of time."
"Come on, Ben, come on..."
Ben's still out there --
Sure.
Hilarious.
"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?"
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Not at all.
"This isn't going to be a problem, is it?"
"Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready."
"Oh, I think you already have."
Please don't make this personal --
Susan. What are you doing?
You said it was urgent.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
"I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about."
"Victor, your scar --"
Just find him.
"Victor, I'm sorry I --"
"Victor, are you feeling alright?"
What's going on?
You can't leave them out there.
Raising the shields.
What are you doing?
"Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think..."
"It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much."
I understand the business reasons.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
"I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm."
It's just business.
Skeptical...?
Reed's gonna fix me up --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
'Scuse me.
All right!!
You want to work at Carl's?
Arnold. What's happening?
"Brad, can I talk to you a minute?"
"I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year."
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
"Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again."
"I don't want to talk about it here, Brad."
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Don't worry about it.
How much did they cost?
Of course.
"Were those flowers really for me, Brad?"
Later.
"Easy, mon."
There it is!
First door on your left!
On the ledge?
It's the first door on your left!
"I can't find it, mon!"
It's the first door on your left.
Totally.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
"Something happened to them, mon."
"Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton."
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
This is how I dress all the time.
"Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?"
Manager!!
"Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass."
"I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here."
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
No. I want my money back right now.
"All right, then. It's your secret."
No.
"You're not going to tell me, are you?"
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
"Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it."
See you later.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Does Mom know you have company?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Are you still a virgin?
But your face did!
I didn't say that.
You are a virgin!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Why?
"Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?"
Well... it's true.
I'm just guessing.
Where did you hear that?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
"You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?"
Is everything okay at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
I'll explain everything later.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
They're not home yet.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Don't strain yourself.
I take out the garbage.
Your friends use the pool too.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Why can't you do it?
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Hey-yo.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Sis.
"Hi, Brad."
You're fired.
"Yes, sir."
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
"Okay, Dennis."
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
But they weren't mine.
"Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good."
They were left over from the last shift.
"Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?"
Any problems?
"Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you."
Jeff you have company!
Dad says!
Leave me alone.
"Dad says you're late again, you butthole!"
Leave me alone!
Ugh.
Dad says you have to get up!
Get going.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
"Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay."
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
"It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic."
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
We've got to get an abortion?
"All right, I take it back."
Take that back.
I know it's yours.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
What? Now?
What's going on?
Hello.
"Look, I'm kind of in a hurry."
I didn't see you this morning.
Oh. Hi.
I guess I did.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
What's wrong?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What? Are you all right?
"Hey, Mike?"
Let's continue.
How about both of us at the same time?
You first.
"Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?"
No. Are you crazy?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
You're a really good kisser.
"He's my friend, too."
Come on...
Are you really a virgin?
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Pick a suit.
Well...
Do you want to take a quick swim?
I know what I look like.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I don't know.
Sure. Come on in.
Do you have any ice tea?
Mark is a really nice boy...
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
What a guy.
Get a ride with somebody.
"Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi."
"Oh, really?"
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Nice to meet you.
"Nice to meet you, Stacy."
"Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too."
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Sensitive -- what is that?
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
"Whatever you say, Rat."
"The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl."
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
"You're losing it, Damone."
Fine. Get lost.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
No Damone. I don't understand.
"If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?"
Chicken!
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Really.
Poor guy.
Okay. See ya.
"Well, I've gotta be running."
Damone! You come here?
"Hey, Mark. Is that you?"
I'm really pretty busy...
"Damone, are you there?"
Did you go home and get it?
Mark. What happened to your date?
Damone. It's Mark.
Yo.
All right. Pay attention.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
"Knock it off, Damone. I need real help."
Ace the jacket.
Yeah?
"Hey, Rat."
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
"That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude."
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
"You tell me, Mike. What do I do?"
Really?
I would. Yeah.
No. It's too soon.
Did you get her name?
No.
Did you get her number?
She's in my biology class.
All right... where did you see her?
"Damone, you gotta listen to me."
It's definitely your mama.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
You should work for yourself.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
"Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda."
Not if you're over sixteen.
And they don't call my parents?
Yes.
Are you Linda Barrett?
"What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?"
Totally.
Are you going to ride that wave?
"That's me, Merv."
Who's that?
Fascinating.
I don't go at all.
How often do you go?
"I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could..."
"I've been swimming, Merv."
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
"Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great."
How've you been?
"Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but..."
That's him! He did it!
"You can't fix this car, Spicoli."
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
My brother is gonna shit.
Just be glad you're all right.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
"All right. Die, Granada Jocks!"
My brother's car!
They're fuckin' with us.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
This ain't no cop.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
I like sex.
All right.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Naw. Any good?
Seen the new Playboy?
Then don't hassle it.
He is.
I thought he was out of town.
"Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car."
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Dartmouth?!
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
But what are you going to do?
"Yeah, like maybe never."
Sometime?
Not coming? What happened?
He's not coming.
Where's Doug?
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
I want romance.
What do you want?
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
"Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!"
I paid for it and everything.
That little prick.
That little prick.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
What?
"You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys."
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
What do you think it is?
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
"I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing."
"God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban."
"God, I don't think so. Better look in the house."
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
"God, he hardly even talks anymore."
No.
"I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?"
I think they're both virgins.
What do you think?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
How long does Doug take?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Does that ever happen?
Climax together.
"You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck."
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
"Okay, penis, that's one, balls..."
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
Sixteen.
"Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?"
Thanks a lot.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Not since November.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
"Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again."
Hey! That's my line!
"Come on, Linda. It's just sex."
"So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?"
It was nice.
You'll always remember your first time.
It was okay.
Was it great?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
There's nothing to it.
Well I never did it.
What's the big deal?
"Like, you know, giving blow jobs."
What variables?
"No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at."
"Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them."
Do you think guys find that attractive?
I know.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
No way! He just called him a dick.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Believe it.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
"If I didn't have a fiancÈ in Chicago, I'd go for it."
"He was hot, wasn't he?"
Really?
I can't do that.
So what did you do?
Should we buy a frame for that?
"He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'"
What should I do?
"Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man."
"Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really."
Don't you like him?
Do you think that guy's cute?
How's it going.
"Aloha, Spicoli."
"Aloha, Mr. Hand!"
"All right! Oh, yeah!"
"Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by."
You're gonna flunk me?!
If you graduate.
"Well, you'll find out next year."
What's that?
"Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?"
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
"Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand."
I don't know. I guess so.
"Do you want to sit there, Jeff?"
"Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?"
"I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff."
"Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?"
"That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?"
Mr... Mr. Hand.
"You better save some for me, you swine!"
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I don't know.
"I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever."
"You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?"
I couldn't make it in time.
"Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?"
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
"Hey, bud. What's your problem?"
Yes.
You just ripped my card in two!
That's the name they gave me.
Mr. Spicoli?
Can I come in?
Really?
"This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window."
What class?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Yes.
Is this your first time?
No. I mean back to your home.
What about those other guys you live with?
I think I better take you home.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Are you really nineteen?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
It's very warm out tonight.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
That's a nice shirt.
"All right, the point it is."
The point sounds fine.
How about the point?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Where do you feel like going?
Thanks. So do you.
"'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight."
No problem.
Thanks for picking me up.
How about your phone number?
What can I get for you tonight.
"I know, everyone says that."
You look like you could still be in high school.
I'd like that.
Really?
"I know everybody says it, but I really mean it."
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
"Hi, Stacy. How are you?"
"Hi, Mark."
I'll get you the notes.
What about the notes?
I made a fool of myself.
Oh. I see.
John Bonham?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What's April 16th?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Where's Mike today?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Do you really have to go?
...I've got to go home.
"Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan."
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Sure.
I don't know.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Naw. I don't mind.
"Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind."
No. That's okay.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Where's your brother?
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
"No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house."
Aren't your parents asleep?
Do you want to come inside?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
"Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck."
I had a really nice time tonight.
Two more Cokes.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Not at all.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Oh yeah.
Are you all right?
Excellent.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you know what you want?
"I've heard that, too."
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. It's my sister's.
This is a nice car.
Sure thing.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Oh... yes.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
What's your other question?
"We keep them, in case the people come back."
You keep them.
We keep them.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
"I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?"
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Okay. Thanks.
Two Cokes.
Anything to drink?
Are you ready to order here?
"Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police..."
Crying? Why was she crying?
Tell me. What do you want?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Killed?
Holy shit!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
"Well, thank you."
"Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay."
"Certainly, Mr. Duke!"
"Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying..."
Righto!
Let's have lunch!
Not for me.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Awake? What do you mean?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
"He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him."
Yes... It makes sense.
What?
Dobermans don't talk.
"Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it."
WHAT?
Naked.
Naked!?
Not where we operate.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
"Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!"
"Rum and ice, please."
What do you mean by that?
Really?
He wanted the pineal gland.
Naw! Not a major.
"We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house."
A major!
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
And nobody did anything?
What happened? What did they do to her?
Not down in my parts.
Naw!
This is my granddaughter...
"Oh, my God!..."
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Las Vegas.
"Where ya comin' from, young man?"
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
What?
"Hell, no!"
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
"Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!"
Never missed a plane yet.
The airport is over there!
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
Do you think you can handle it?
"So do we, lady."
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Yes!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Right!
Extract of pineal!
Some of what?
"Never mind, it's absolutely pure."
Where'd you get this?
Adrenochrome...
What is this?
It's gone too far.
Me?
"No, she's looking for you."
Lucy is looking for you.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
"What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it."
They were all veterans.
"Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons."
...and every one of them stacked naked...
Like big lizards.
Read the newspapers.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
"Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!"
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
"I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done."
"Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra..."
Us?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
"NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!"
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! Stop talking like that.
Lucy.
Plans?
WELL? What are your plans?
You degenerate pig!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
The cops?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
"You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?"
Are you ready?
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Jesus.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
I want that fucking radio!
Whatever's right.
How about a check?
"Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit."" I want a rising sound."
What tape?
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
What limes?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Where'd you get that knife?
"That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!"
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
He told me he was turning in early...
What for?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
When does this thing stop?
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
I want to leave fast.
Can we make it?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
GO?
I have to go.
Not much. Why?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Jesus creeping shit!
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Why what?
Why?
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
That's good...
What are you talking about?
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
Shoot it.
"No, no. Don't leave me!"
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Lacerda?
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
How long do I have?
You whore!
"Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?"
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
"The medicine? Yes, it's right here."
Where's the medicine?
My heart!
"My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!"
Damn right!
...and we're chock full of that!
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
"Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right."
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Jesus! Did I say that?
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
"""One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."""
I fear nothing.
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
You'd pay me for that?
No! I swear I'm not!
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
That's a strange attitude.
You realize...
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
"Could I have that, please?"
"Of course, officer."
May I see your license.
"Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people."
You and a lot of other people.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
What?
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
"In that case, maybe she can help."
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Part of what?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
I don't know what you're talking about!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
"They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!"
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Stop!
Spare me.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
"I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?"
Where is everyone?
"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you."
We're going to get my little girl.
Where are you two going?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We'll meet in three hours?
"Um, yeah, thirty miles east."
You know where it is?
"Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!"
They'll be back.
We should go! We should go right now!
"Don't be stupid, drop the gun!"
I will not die because of him!
"I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --"
Careful.
Right.
We can't risk letting them in.
With what just happened upstairs --
I don't think you should...
"I got shells too, box and a half, tops."
But it's got teeth.
"Well, it don't look pretty."
Her fella.
"Nah, I got the gun."
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Yeah.
IS IT CLEAR?!
We're lucky to be alive.
We shot a skunk.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Stop it.
Anyone.
Who the hell would you call?
Gonna stay for a couple?
"One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry."
You gotta be with me on this.
"Well, your last words can be ""I told you so."""
"We'll be food, dickheads!"
You got something better?
OPEN THE DOOR!
Wha?
"""OH!?"" WHAT IS ""OH?"" What does ""oh"" mean?"
Oh!
"Come on, come on."
"Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps."
Upstairs.
Where's that?
I think I know where a CB is.
C'mon guys--
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Just move!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Shit!
We just smeared a skunk.
"In the corner, behind the curtain."
Where's the tunnel?
Follow me.
You all sure about this?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
What's it for?
What tunnel? Where?
There's a tunnel.
Easy.
"Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke."
Hey!
They're right here.
"Well, justice is funny."
"So, your husband ditched you?"
And the head?
And that's how I ended up here.
"Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside."
And the rest of 'em?
"Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?"
Just an observation.
"That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?"
Look.
What?
Ohhh.
The door... on three.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
No. You?
Scared?
Get in line!
Fuck you too.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
My truck.
"What now, Geronimo?"
He's dead.
Come on!
Who's with me?
We're better off.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Oh yeah?
"I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it."
Go douche.
You weren't helpin'.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Fuck no.
Why don't you go check it out?
"So, what now? Did those things leave?"
We lived near power lines.
Your parents of relation?
Yep.
"Your brother, huh?"
"Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera."
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
But not flush against the tunnel?
"Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back."
"Nothing, this was my last delivery."
What's in the back?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What?
We gotta be close.
Anybody else?
We gotta try.
We're going to get help.
Anyone else?
I'm in.
What? Really?
How much you got to see the show?
"How much I got, what?"
How much you got?
Sure.
"You wanna see, baby?"
The girl's got rhythm.
Um-hmmm.
"I can't feel a thing, Hon."
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Okay then.
"It's much safer in there, sweety."
But --
Why not then?
Will I go crazy or something?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Really?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
"Oh, no."
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
What is this?
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Oh.
"Push and twist, it's child proof."
Well...
How are you holding up?
"Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!"
Keys.
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Max?
Holds four.
How many?
Covered.
Open?
Two.
Four door?
Fully.
Is it gassed up?
What's it for!?
Nothing.
What's going on between you two?
Huh?
What do you mean what?
What?
What?
"You're wasting your time, there's no one out there."
"No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed."
"In the kitchen, under the sink."
Good.
Will these boards hold?
He shot you the other time.
Huh?
He only shot you once.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What?
He's dead.
"Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?"
My husband...
"What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon."
I'll go with ya.
"I wouldn't do that, son."
"I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew."
"Sit still, look less like a meal."
Oh? And what's that?
"You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy."
Whoa!
Get outta here.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Clear!
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What the hell's going on here!?
Clever fuckers.
No bullshit.
Bullshit.
"Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?"
You smell like ass!
They were all over the place.
F-f-fuck you.
Welcome back.
"Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?"
Get something on that.
"Yeah, maybe."
HELLLLLLLLP!!
COME ON!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
SHIT.
Hurry!
If he doesn't shut up...
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Shit!
You keep that key handy.
Move it!
No shit.
Move slow and move quiet.
What?!
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
"Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?"
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
What?
"NO, but I will lock you in."
Gimme the keys.
"Fine, Chief."
Duh hickey.
"'Eh, Chief?"
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Got 'cha!
HELLLPPP!
OH JESUS!
"Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose."
Am I too heavy for you?
Amazing you made it this far.
"I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good."
BONSAI!
HELP MEEE!
I'm sure.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Let's move.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
"Yeah, I'll go."
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
"Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?"
Hey!
"Well, maybe they migrate?"
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Let's wait it out.
YOU'LL HIT US!
DON'T!
"She's not very nice, is she?"
Let's go.
"Nothing, just lookin'."
What's wrong?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
GO-GO-GO!!
Get to your cars!
Go!!!
Not without you!!!
Go! Go!
Wait God-dammit!
Let's go!
Whoa!
Hold it!
That's fine.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
"So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks."
"Okay, well that's something."
"Father. The biggest, the strongest..."
And the last one is the...
"If you are face to face with her, dive left."
I think --
Did we make it?
I'd love to.
We should stick together out there.
Deal.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I'll do anything to help.
Oh...
Her name is Charlie.
Right.
"We all have to be strong, right?"
I admire your strength.
"I'm fine, I really am."
You know you don't have to do this.
All right.
Let's lock off this room.
Stop her!
That's one piece of four problems.
Oh my God... What is that?
I just hit it like you said.
"What have you done now, broke the darn thing?"
I said I'm not lying.
"You know that no one likes a liar, right?"
I'm not lying.
What did we say about lying?
Well...
Are you lying to me?
"Um, well..."
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
"Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?"
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
'Forgive'...? For What?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Putting on my armor.
What're you doing?
"Refill my drink, will you, Bob?"
Frances?  Oh no.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
"So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?"
"You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em."
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Well... come on.
"Oh. I mean, good."
"Excuse me, sir?"
"I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me..."
Very fine bone structure.
"I guess so, sir."
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
"Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option."
Who's this?
"Good morning, Mr. Bebe!"
I'd like nothing better.
"That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act."
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
"No, I'm concerned with everything."
"But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe."
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Thank you --
You see: We've got to change that name.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
...acts. I'll relay your message.
"I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?"
You know what I mean.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
"Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --"
My clothes?
"Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes."
"Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way."
"Hi Frances, got a minute?"
Come here. I want to show you something.
Huh.
"Okay, but come here first."
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Thank you.
Madam...?
What?
"Good, good. Give them that."
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
"He knows, Frances."
Right now we have to be practical.
What does Clifford say?
"I know, but --"
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
A rich actress.
An actress.
Who?
You don't think I'm good enough?
"Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London."
What's up?
Oh.
He's not here.
Where's Clifford?
Frances.
"Hello, Harold."
"I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford."
Who is she?
"Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me."
You're under arrest.
GET OUT!
"Get your clothes on, lady --"
Get your clothes on.
"I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it."
"In my eyes, officer."
"Hey, where's the fire, sister?"
You want his name?
What night?
"No. It's all about that night, isn't it?"
No?
Dick...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
"Dick, I can't even breathe here..."
"Dick, we need some time apart --"
Showdown.
Without me.
...Yes.
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Fired?
"Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?"
Claire?
Who?
There've been some calls.
Sort of.
You learn your lines?
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
"All square, Doc."
"We're all square now, Harry. Right?"
I gotta go now.
Harry!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
"The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her."
"Thank you, Harry."
"We'll get you home, Frances."
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
...I see.
"Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice."
"No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better."
...Don't you?
I know you believe that.
Thank you.
"New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!"
Really?
But I'll never win that.
"Thank you, Ralph."
No. Never.
Were you a drug addict?
No.
Were you an alcoholic?
"I pity us, Dad. I pity us both."
Are you... are you hungry?
Daddy!
"Please, Francie..."
"They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know."
"Francie, you know I can't do that."
"I love you too, Francie."
"I don't care, Dad. I love you."
"I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and..."
Always. Always.
"Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?"
"But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?"
"I know that, Dad, but --"
"I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you."
...So what do you think?
"Be careful, Francie."
"I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad."
...Then go.
"If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it."
And you think it's worth all this?
Of course.
You really want to go?
"What do I do, Dad?"
"Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --"
I know.
"It's already started, Dad... with me."
"He's a socialist, then?"
Is Kaminski a Communist?
"Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?"
"You wrote it, didn't you?"
I didn't have much to do with it.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
"Thanks, Dad."
"I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances."
"See you next weekend, Dad."
"Bye, baby."
"That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought."
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
"As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due."
See you next weekend?
Good.
I'm going back to the hotel.
"No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism."
"They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways."
You're poisoning that child's mind.
"When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?"
Thank you.
Bread?
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
"Oh Angela, my own... Angela!"
"Oh, Kurt!"
"But, Kurt, I..."
"Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain..."
Kurt!
Occupation?
Address?
Fifteen.
Age?
Name?
"You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me."
Just one minute...
"Why, you... you little bastard!"
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
What is this?
"Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean."
What?
What about your husband?
They'll mend.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
...Not if I can help it.
Aren't you ever going back?
"No, I don't hate it."
You sound as if you hate it.
Why?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why... yes.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Are you an actor?
"Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood."
