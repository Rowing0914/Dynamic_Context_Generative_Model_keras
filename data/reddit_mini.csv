"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."
"They don't get paid for how much time you spend building your army. They get paid when you gem it. Having a premade layout saves what, 30 seconds? During that time they've made $0 and still have the ability to make $X if you decide to gem it. "
"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."

"Implement some form of tenure for mods and require a majority vote to remove any tenured mod. Only allow mods to trigger a removal vote on mods lower than them in the hierarchy however.

This removes the possibility of a single mod (such as an absentee top mod) swooping in and blowing up the sub but doesn't create opportunities for hijacking. Importantly, it also doesn't require rejiggering the existing mod hierarchies or ongoing admin involvement in dispute resolution."

"&gt;Baltimore County prosecutors will speak to the victim's family before deciding whether to charge Shattuck, reports the station.

Earlier the parents said: 

&gt;""What she did to my son is heinous. The fact that she paraded her pedophilia in front of her own son is even more disturbing,"" the mother said. ""Any adult who rapes a child deserves to be in prison. Please hold her accountable.""

It seems like they probably will ask that they send her to prison. I hope they do. Honestly that judge basically gave the green light to any adult woman to molest little boys free of consequence in the future and that's simply not acceptable.

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita.

"Don't


Just take them before/after.


I take PreparE before going out and RecoverE on the come down and my rolls have always been pleasant and my comedowns minimal.  Both can be found on [ravesafer.com](http://www.ravesafer.com)


If you really must take some in with you, the PreparE pack only has 3 pills in it (all of the supplements are combined into these 3 pills), so it's far easier to get them into places than having all the supplements separately.

"&gt; Key word there is ""were"". As I nodded to when I said ""Yeah, back in 1960"".

Which is what I referred to. I pointed out the *history* of the use of nullification logic.

&gt;Guess what? This isn't 1960. It's 2015, 

And so what? So people don't have bad idea? A bigot won't use the same logic to refuse to convict? If it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a drug charge"" it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a rape charge"".

[Here's](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/indiana-law-force-cops-overturned-mans-battery-officer-charge/) a case where a man slamming his house's door against an officer's foot was deemed legal because the officer didn't have probable cause to investigate his house.

&gt; But the appeals court reasoned that, “Constable Webb had entered Cupello’s apartment without consent, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or exigent circumstances. Because Constable Webb resisted Cupello’s subsequent attempts to close the door, Cupello had a reasonable belief that force was necessary to terminate Constable Webb’s unlawful entry into his apartment.”"

"I think *M* is one of the most interesting early sound films. Fritz Lang really made incredible use of sound, especially for a director who had predominantly done silent films at the time. Much of the film is completely silent which adds to the suspense for me and the anxiety that the film creates. There's never really a wasted sound clip, every line of dialogue is extremely important. Even Peter Lorre's whistling is integral to the plot."

At least candidates like Clinton or Bush have the political muscle to get what they say done. "

The big discussion was about Arsenal - and Arsenal don't have that physically imposing midfielder other teams do"
"It's why these ""roles"" that Smite have are really fucking annoying when more unique gods enter the game.

Smite  gods are lumped in the different pools where roughly the same items are bought, with roughly the same playstyle and are put in roughly the same lanes, with few exceptions."

It's all dependent on what kind of effect you want really. In terms of summoning or buffing. I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage. Specifically for a xenon you probably want a **flashy** soul since it gives an all stats boost if you can't manage to find/buy a magnificent soul."

"F striker is all about close combat and high damage combos, F nen is about ranged attacks and support, f grappler is holds and crowd control. Out of curiosity, what level did you get your f brawler to, I have actually found mine to be quite a lot of fun most of the way through.

In terms of which of those is the most fun to level, for the average person its probably going to be grappler. Striker does not really become fun until you get lightning dance at level 40, and nen is probably going to be completely boring to you until you get a bunch of cube skills (what this will mean to you is different per player). I personally have enjoyed my f nen all the way through (currently sitting at 82), it helps a lot early on to supplement with sand splash and low kick, converting them to magic damage with the conversion option."
"Thanks to the despicable Judge Stephen Williams for explaining why our system of law is dog shit and our system of checks and balances is horribly broken in this document.

&gt;One judge in Friday’s appellate ruling went so far as to defend the NSA’s right not to reveal whether a plaintiff had actually been spied on or not. “Plaintiffs complain that the government should not be allowed to avoid liability simply by keeping the material classified,” wrote Stephen Williams. “But the government’s silence regarding the scope of bulk collection is a feature of the program, not a bug.”

Which should bring to mind an older, relevant document.

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But **when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**"
"That is a pretty rude answer. He didn't say that he wants doyalst answers only that immediately banning people doesn't really help anyone.

I much prefer watsonian discussions but there are times dolayst information has a place as well. If we had a spoiler tag we could use to put that under it would be the best of both worlds. The information could be presented in the relevant location but those who want a purely watsonian argument don't have to be interrupted with it. Also there is no logical reason to ban meta discussion involving multiple settings. Again that leads to great discussions. Being a mod you can either work with the community or for yourself. Maybe you should consider what you want to do. "
"It's true that vaccines aren't 100%.  No medication or medical procedure is 100% safe.  There is a risk that some people's bodies will ""overreact"", similar to an allergic reaction.  It's extremely rare, but it is a risk.  There is also a slight risk if the vaccine was stored improperly and bacteria infected the vile (this happens more frequently today because anti-vaxx advocates pushed for eliminating preservatives from vaccines because of misinformation about the preservatives on the internet, particularly thimerosal).

&gt; Lastly, doctors are not scientific leaders. They take the position of being told what to do and are, from day one, under the control of the drug manufactures.

It's not just doctors that agree vaccines are safe, it's the entire scientific community, because the scientific evidence is overwhelming and there has never been a scientifically verified reproducible study that has shown there is a significant danger to any vaccine in use today.  Period.

Millions of people take vaccines, and people who take vaccines are no more likely to develop any type of condition than those who don't."

"I am testing the mods atm, will post my impressions here.

1. The armor plates mod seems balanced to me, not overpowered.

2. Azimuth's oxygen generators are 1x1x1, this is almost OP. I'd rather had them 1x1x2. Haven't tested the tank volume and the oxy generator performance yet.

3. I tested this wake bomb and fell in love with it. It's requires completely different approah to bombing, as well as skill and luck. Not OP but fun as hell. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354194728

4. Azimuth batteries are, in my opinion, OP, as well as their ""fusion"" reactors. Totally destroys the balance, irregardless of the resourse cost.

5. The ""armored"" thrusters look much better, provide the same amount of thrust, and the additional ""armor"" is almost non-existent. Can take a couple more gatling bullets, so not OP, but look much better and should make it into vanilla game. **Large ship armored thrusters require to be adjusted to the latest vanilla game rebalance!**

6. RCS thrusters are very good, should be in vanilla game too. Excellent for precise docking maneuvers, useless for anything else.

7. Accumulators and capacitors are great and seem balanced to me! Accumulators work like batteries that can store more energy, but their output is weaker. Could be great for storing solar energy in bases and large ships. Capacitors are the opposite: very low storage, but can provide big current, thus compensating for intermittent overloads. I checked the storage and output values vs battery volume. The 1x1x1 mini battery is fine, but the slim battery is a little underpowered and needs to be adjusted.

8. Afterburner is a very interesting concept, although, the implementation could be better. I'd like to have those in the game, and I even considered making a similar mod myself, but there is already an existing one.

9. The solar batteries mod I suggested includes centered panels as well. I checked the power output vs surface vs the vanilla panels. Big ships panels provide exactly the same power/surface area, and the small ship panels are just slightly less efficient.

"If your energy is effected that severely, your daily calories are probably below your [Basal Metabolic Rate](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator). 


1. My BMR is 2064 cal/day, and I want to loose about 1.5 lb/week. 
2. I calculated my TDEE as 2477 (1.2 x BMR) since my job is sedentary. 
3. Now I want to lose 1.5 lb/week (1.5 lb/wk * 3500 lb/cal = 5250 cal/wk), but if I cut my diet by 750 (5250/7) cals/day to 1727 cal/day, I'd be below my BMR and very lethargic (like you describe). 
4. Instead I do about 2500 cal/wk of cardio and cut my diet to 2080 cal/day, just above my BMR.
5. My net calories per week is something like: (Food - TDEE) * 7 - Cardio = Deficit (2080-2477)*7-2500 = -5279 (close enough to my goal of 5250)

Hope this all makes sense! Let me know if you'd like another example with your numbers?

"&gt; I'm a pro-lifer and I don't consider myself a social conservative.

Well that's fine and dandy that you don't consider yourself one; you *do* hold a social conservative view on at least one issue.

"The ONDP targeted their messaging at blue-collar non-Toronto Ontario. The OLP successfully painted that as a move to the right, and continually claimed that they had produced the most progressive budget in history.

That's why the ONDP kept their vote and seat totals basically even, while seeing it shift away from Toronto. That's why people like Jonah Schein lost their seats. (Tellingly, it was the MPPs with unimpeachable leftist bona fides who survived, like Cheri DiNovo.)

The subsequent programme of the Liberals in government, however, has been radically neoliberal, stepping up attacks on unions and kicking the pace of privatisations into high gear. Anyone gullible enough to believe the hype about the OLP's supposed outlefting the ONDP has has learned the error oh their ways, and I don't think they're gonna fall for it this time when Trudeau tries it."

"Because a Google search for how to do Aetherial Reduction lead me here only to tell me ""Hey! you should do that thing you're trying to figure out how to do! gl buddy!"" ...Not OP's fault, but in case anyone else ran into this frustration...

Here's how you do it:

1. Find an ephemeral node. I farm furrymints in Twinpools W. Coerthas from 12a - 4a for example, but they're on a timer all over the new areas. [There's probably a guide somewhere.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes)

2. Switch on the Collector's Glove action before digging/hacking. It's in your actions list.. the hand by the square/pyramid thingy. It's a permanent thing that stays on.

3. Here's where I was getting confused. Click your furrymint or whatever and it will go to a screen with a 30/30 and it won't let you do jack (which was the point I started doing Google searches and found this thing about how awesome the thing I can't do is)

4. Don't do what I did instead do this.

5. Hit the skill Discerning Eye. Why? Still don't know. Just do it.

6. Now you can hit Utmost Caution skill and maybe some other stuff... again I still don't know what's going on, but it works :p

7. After hitting these cool skills you've had for 2 months without a clue as to what they did you can use ""Methodical Appraiser"" --which is the gather this stuff skill. You'll get something collectible woohoo.

8. Repeat that stuff till the node is empty. 

9. Go to your items, and now those collectibles will give you the option to Aetherial Reduce them.

I know nothing about how to get the best stuff, what the actions do, but it's a start, and it's better than yelling at Google for taking you here for an hour. gl."

Mazda revamped nearly their whole lineup in 2012 and put the most efficient all-gas engine in the Mazda 3.  Gets better gas mileage than the Corolla or Civic and has more power as well.

"That's a very well explained post, here you have my upvote, fellow colleague. 

Just to clear some things up, I tried to express in the PS that I don't mean every single one of us nor every single legitimate complaint; in fact I said in the first paragraph that I understand them and of course there are things that could be better. My limited english only allows me to explain myself up to a certain point, but the overall point is we are overreacting as a whole, at average, even though there are legitimate complaints and things that could (and should) be fixed/changed.  

And even though some changes were made towards more expending or more time consuming, I think that overall they are giving us much more than they ""took"" from us. We got lots of covers to collect and we complain we can't get them all. We got new modes and we complain they are too time consuming. We got new heroes and we complain we can get them easy. We got new costumes and we complain they won't be there forever. I think you can see the pattern.

Also, sometimes we can't stop believing we have the right to have it all or win it all; I wouldn't expect the game to allow me to be #1 in Battleworld with a team of 4* by only pairing me with teams like mine, the same way people don't expect to compete in real life only with same-category people instead of the whole spectrum (i.e. entering in a top university with a low SAT grade; if you don't have top grades you don't go to top places, I think it's fair). I'm sure the matchmaking could be fixed, but at some point you should be paired with teams better than yours in order to hit a ""wall"" at your class. Btw with 60 wins I'm in the top 5000 for the reward, close to the end, so it's not THAT time consuming I'd say. And then again, it's not like you'll miss a big reward, it's more like ""voluntary"". 

Thank you for your two cents :) I think that we can meet each other in the middle after all ;)"

Unless you're the second coming of the greatest Magic player ever, after playing for a month you have absolutely no clue why certain cards should be in what slot, what the tricks and interactions between cards are, what interactions exist, when it's optimal to play something, when to hold priority to respond to a trigger.

There's so much to it that you're basically jumping into the deep end, because being the person who actually designs the cube really requires and understanding that's a step beyond just understanding how to draft, it's needing to understand how the entire system works together.

"I used to think *Fahrenheit 451* was about censorship too, but recently I learned that it's actually a warning about how TV will make people forget about the written word, and now that I think about it, that's exactly what happened in the book: people chose to get rid of books in favor of TV walls."
"I know exactly how you feel. I want to be able to be open about it so bad, but I live in Louisiana. Which is pretty much one of the worst places to be open about it considering we don't even have decent medicinal laws. (Oil only and for very few conditions) If I was in a state like Colorado I'd have no problem with it. The fact that you're working for a place that receives federal funding really complicates things I feel. It's admirable and right that you'd feel this way, but it's probably for the best that you keep it on the down low for the next year at least. "
"Those ""23 steps"" are only needed in case of a market outage, which is very rare. In all other cases, finalizing is as easy as it was on Agora. So it's a win-win here, if the market is up everything goes smoothly, if the market is down you can still get your coins (unlike centralized escrow)

Also, it is more like 6 steps of copy-pasting, not 23. You know, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. That thing we all learned how to do in the third grade. If a vendor is too lazy to learn how to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V coins to himself, and would rather have his coins under the control of the market who can exit at any time, then that is his decision.

Additionally, it's difficult to arbitrarily lose your coins in this process, as the console will give you a nice little error notice in red if you screw up Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V'ing something. It's not like your coins will go into oblivion.

Btw, timelocking a 2-of-2? ""Vendors can exit scam with escrow""? You sound like a dumbass... Unless you're trolling, which, congratulations, that is some very good bait"
"Ramos is a decent defender behind the plate.

Gio was sucking even with Lobaton.  Anyways, correlation does not equal causation.

Matt has been alright, considering what he's been given.  He's still a below average manager and he for sure fucked up the series in New York last month."
"I'm definitely considering that scenario and that's why I would link my movement skill to blood magic. Also, ew, that heart and soul cluster. I would feel dirty taking hybrid life/mana nodes when using EB. But I guess it can't be helped."
"Personally, I would prefer this to be an inclusive place for anyone that would like to mock, discuss and document the decay of our capitalist societies.

I would also prefer it to be based in post about real events occuring in the world, new and old, that speaks to that theme. I don't think memes themselves should be featured here, unless they manifest in real life on their own. 

But, I'm not intending to be a despot and I want to hear your ideas. As this is a very new sub I think setting the direction we want earliy and in agreeance with the users we have at this point is key. So please share your ideas and any suggestions. 

At the same time, I don't think it should be a super-serious-all-the-time place either. I would like it to be grounded in real events. With the occasional zesty meme. "
"&gt; Comet storm killing 2 2/1s = RR{1} + 2 kickers, so RR[3].

For Comet Storm to kill 2 X/1's, it only needs to be kicked once, for RR[2]. You get one target just for casting the spell normally. In fact, for killing any number of X/1's, Comet Storm will cost the same as Rolling Thunder.  Comet Storm comes out ahead when you want to deal more than one damage to multiple targets."
"With respect, I think you're putting way too much interpretation in the comments from the story.

I mean, we don't need actual force for rape - if you're passed out of otherwise unable to give consent you can't consent.  Yes, we're being fucked in this in the both drunk, or ""she had one drink"" type bullshit, but rape is the absence of consent for sex...easy and simple.

The prosecutor's comment isn't supportive of changing one's mind after the fact - their prosecution hinged on whether or not she went to the party to have sex, she could still choose to not consent when the situation actually presents itself.  I see no argument that she should be able to change her mind after the fact.

And of course the parents of the little snowflake are going to stand up for their little snowflake.  They're not going to come out an issue a statement telling the world their daughter is a stupid bitch for even going, or wanting to fuck before the party.  Its irrelevant to the story, because every parent will act like that if they believe their snowflake was actually raped.

I do think that this guy probably got fucked by the system (shocking, I know) - but realistically, many of your complaints about the story otherwise seem unfounded.  Just my two cents."
"I second FTL. You'll love it. Guaranteed.

I'd also recommend 'No More Room in Hell' - it's a free Source engine title about survivng from zombies. Despite it's mixed rep, I love it. There's no P2W at all, and it's great for a laugh with a few friends. I regularly return to it with a friend, and it's just great banter.

Not sure if it's considered 'mainstream', but I'd highly recommend the original Metro 2033 if you can get your hands on it (Humble Bundle usually give it away free every year or so). Stellar story, gameplay, and a great title to burn through and enjoy. They released 'Metro Redux', which is 2033 remastered and it's sequel Last Light in a bundle pack. I haven't played the Redux version of 2033 other than a quick jam because I bought the bundle for LL Redux, but they've changed it up too much for my liking. Metro Last Light Redux is fine as there's not much in the way of remastering given it was released so close to the Redux-ing."
"Back in the 90s I remember listening to The City Sleeps by MC 900 Foot Jesus, while driving on a windy forested road at night. Definitely have me goosebumps. Maybe a bit cheesy now but I still dig it. 

Also, I wrote it in another comment, the album Maxinquaye by Tricky fits your requirements exactly. From the opening drum. It's eerie dark and beautiful. "
"Who in the Hell did Bobby Jindal think he was by attempting to dictate what ANY President addresses in their speeches?  He needs to know his place in this country.  Governors do NOT dictate to any U.S. President.  

President Obama was correct to ignore Jindal's request given the damage that climate change has inflicted upon Lousianna, particularly New Orleans."
"If you are connected to the repeater you will experience a drop in speed about 50%.  You'll probably also interfere with other networks around you so as well which will also hurt the quality of the connection. But the upside is that you will have a connection in your room.

You can always try buying you own router and see how that works out. I'd recommend something of quality if you are in a super-congested area (which sounds like you are). Buy something like an ASUS RT-AC66U, put your current modem into bridge mode, and connect the router to that. With some high-quality Ethernet cable that is long enough you should be able to move the router to a more favorable position and have a better signal overall."
"I don't have *that* much of an issue with them, other than the fact that they are apparently buff albino handsome Squidwards... I away saw them as abstract elephantine biomechanoids, like how Giger designed them. 


But I do like how they created the xenos, I always though the xenos were artificial in origin."
"That's what I don't understand. You know that all you have to do is stand behind minions to not get grabbed and yet you still just stand in the open and let Blitz pull you under tower and then complain that he's OP.

I know a lot of times people in low elo are making mistakes like that because they don't know what to do, or they don't know how to deal with a certain ability or champion, but when you know what you're supposed to do (which it seems everyone does with Blitz) and then you still don't do it I just don't understand that."
"Fritz 13 is funny when you play it. ''So das ware die schach.''

I use scid vs PC and load houdini 1.5 on it. It's simple, easy to use for when I want to follow a top game to see whats going on when my frail mind can't handle it."
"Personally, I use after effects.  Don't quote me on it, but I was under the impression that flash is a vector-based animation program.  I used AE because it's an animation and compositing program that works with vectors, rasters, and is built to be friendly with 3D programs.  I know nothing about toonboom."
"For gaming, and particularly MS FSX, you want a stronger CPU. Intel is more recommended for what you're doing. Also 8gb of RAM is more than enough for a gaming machine right now.

I swapped some parts out for others that are faster, higher quality and better for the money.

"My interpretation: Gom Jabbar is an ancient non-Latin incantation in HPMORverse which Draco just happened to have researched in old dark tomes, and far predates the writings we're familiar with. 

Frank Herbert somehow picked up on the phrase, either overhearing it in passing or perhaps by having some actual knowledge of the magical world (e.g. magical relative or somesuch)."
"We do need to significantly decrease the amount of lords. Or find a new way of appointing them. I've always favoured the idea that professional bodies could nominate their own representatives (ie: the General Medical Council, the Royal Society, Institution of Engineering and Technology, various charities, even the Conservative and Labour Parties themselves for political lords.) to hold a position in the House. So they're real technocrats with years of experience that are willing to represent both the interests and knowledge of their organisations in a legislative capacity.

Bit of a pipe dream, though."
"A jumper at my DZ landed herself in a coma with brain damage during an out landing.  It was definitely due to an unforced error on her part, and landing out is something you should always be prepared for cause sometimes it *is* the better option, but lets not pretend like there's never anything to it."
"Makes me sick when I see people say Anti Vaxxer's are an example of ""Natural Selection"" and they deserve it. No one deserves to have their kids paralyzed from polio. This website's top comments show that no one cares about trying to get anti vaxxers informed or preventing disease. they just want to be intellectually superior and mock."

"i don't need to re-read your comment where you misunderstand the proposition and suggest that it would be *less* confusing to provide a completely separate keybind that duplicates the function of something that could be handled by one key with a 3rd option. i already read that stupidity and understood how wildly off base you were - that's why i stepped in to call you insane.

your solution is to provide ANOTHER ball cam key... lol. PSYONIX PLS HIRE THIS GUY FOR GREAT CROSS PLATFORM UI/UX."
"From the male side. Dating another INTJ is a very unique proposition. Being with a woman you can respect for her brain and character is something not many men get to experience. There is immediate understanding, ability to work through issues with nearly no effort, and discussions almost always end with the satisfaction of having found a solution.

There are only 3 things to check, from my experience and reading comments here and elsewhere: 

(a) are both people mature enough to enjoy investing in the relationship and dedicating it some time? If not it will fizzle out.
(b) are both people stable (i.e. no personality disorders)? - INTJ life is hard, many of us carry baggage which can be destabilizing; baggage which is transparent until the moment one gets into an intimate situation with another person and there are feelings on the line.
(c) is there limbic system attraction and can it be sustained. This involves both taking care of the looks department (very hard when you are in the middle of a project) and also just having some traits particular to your gender that keep the lower brain layers of the other person ""on board"" with the plan. Possibly in (c) there is a lot of variability, going from people who couldn't care less about anything other than intelligence (mostly INTP-land), to people who want a more complete package (towards ENTJ land). "
"The Seattle Opera has these.  They're at the back of the upper balcony so the view isn't great, but the speakers mean you can at least hear just fine, but no one can hear you.

I know this because if you feel sick they'll let you use them as well, especially since very few people bring kids to the opera in the first place.  That way you can cough or moan and not bother people who paid $600 for their seats or what-have-you."
"&gt; They did it without paywalls and also without excessive tracking and advertisements.
&gt;

&gt; Then Google came in

Youtube did not have advertising (or even revenue) until *after* google bought it. They were a startup quickly burning through cash, and google bought them for the audience and tried to make it sustainable. "
"I'm not sure - I only know that a while back I tried to link to the Express (to point out how terrible it was) and my comment was auto-deleted. Which is probably why this post links to an archived version, rather than the page itself."
"It will likely go on to your final destination.

If you bag arrives in the final destination airport before you,  it will be in baggage claim then put back somewhere.  You'll need to claim it though an office.  "
"H blademaster is generally pretty bad for assa, I'd suggest grabbing normal class trinket/ heroic censer if those are available to you. Now that you have 4set, your uptime on envenom should be extremely high, specially during execute phase, so you'll definetly see a significant increase in dps on certain fights (gorefiend, tyrant, etc.). 
Now, to the logs: On the reaver kill your popped your CDs before bloodlust. Again, I've said this today, this is only a small dps loss for rogues compared to other classes but it is still a dps loss. I do however believe this was due to lust being popped late and not you misplaying, but do keep this in mind. 
About combat, I do suggest using blade master + soul cap on iskar and xhul like i said a couple comments earlier, tho I'd use soul cap + class on advanced trash. I wouldn't play combat on council, specially considering your OS is assa, which is even better than sub for council. Combat is probably the worst spec, it's all ""fluff"" damage since gurtogg is the real prio. Hope it was useful advice, your logs look solid overall. 
"
"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't care about the aim assist but holy crap I like to play on high sensitivity so I can have an advantage on other players but I can't do that when this bull shit sniper scope moves around so damn fast. "
"Dragon Quest VI... It's okay. I've been marathoning the DQ series for the first time, and was really excited to get to VI since it brought back the vocation system. I'm having fun mixing abilities onto characters...but the story so far has been utterly boring and confusing. None of the characters are very interesting either. Coming off of V, this is a big let down. Otherwise, I'm still kinda having fun exploring stuff and I think that's what DQ does best; gives you a semi-open world to explore.

Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii)... I've needed to play it for a long time and I'm finally making my way through it. I really want to give this game a 10/10 because of the spectacle of it all; it can be breathtaking...but I can't. The story is a bit slow right now though I'm positive it'll get better. The characters seem pretty cool. But the gameplay...it feels like there's way too many systems going on. Affinity with NPCs, Affinity (coins?) with party members, Skill links, Party Gauge, Chains, Gem creation, random items scattered all over the ground for idk what reason, getting equipment drops with totally different stats and some being slotted or perma-slotted, weird targeting system, the whole random ""Press B for a morale boost, whatever that does!"" in battle... it feels like it's too much yet none of it totally goes over my head so I'm still enjoying it all. Also Gaur Plains theme is probably the best video game song ever made."
"Either way there's gender disparities, gender issues involved. Predicated on the fact women feel the need to be more attentive since they fear/will be seen as less than they are (even unconsciously) and guys who feel it's not masculine, that it's weak (so, feminine) of them to *have* emotional and mental health problems. "
"I still can't play a single game without the game crashing. I can't even alt-tab after that and have to either restart the pc or use Win + R to use taskkill (completely blind because i just see a black screen). 

Also the input lag is horrible and somehow my settings are always reset when i start the game (when it crashes + when i close it normally). So i also have to set everything to reduce the stupid input lag...

I have no idea how the XB and PC beta are so horrible after the really good PS4 beta...

Specs: I5-4590, R9 390, 8GB RAM, Win 10 Professional"
"As someone who introduced it to my GF, I'd recommend taking it at her pace. Dota2 can be overwhelming, because there's so much to learn. Let her do the tutorials, watch the vids (just youtube it, there's some great ones), watch the International with her, with commentary. They're great to explain, rewind and explain. GL"
"Even stopping to take photos, sightseeing along the way, keeping up a conversation with a friend. I'd be bored as fuck doing it for that long. At my slowest dawdle I walk at 3 miles an hour. Slowing down beyond that I just can't fathom. "
"Well, considering that even a diamond can be broken with a head-on collision with a bullet, the homeworld likely couldn't fight earth's armies head-on.
If the homeworld had tanks or artillery, or something of that sort, pack your bags."
"&gt; bringing it up just comes off as a stab against AJ

Because at this point this is the only thing WWE cares about. They've always been petty when it comes to bad terms with former employees. They would never acknowledge AJ and use her time with the company and her friendship with Paige on a storyline."
"http://imgur.com/QIeXtFD.jpg

Sorry for the crusty pic and dusty pc but anyway thanks for the giveaway/congrats to whoever wins if I don't."
"Entitlement is a bitch huh. Poor people probably feel like they have a right to the contents of my savings account and retirement fund too.

After all it's fucking bullshit that I'm just leaving that money sitting there unspend."
"I don't mind thinking through an at-bat. David Cone does it on YES often, but seemingly every other sentence from Curt's mouth begins with *I*. We know you were a pitcher, Curt.     
He can discuss pitch sequences, locations and the like without constantly reminding us that he used to play the game.

"&gt; Ironically I'm raised eastern and western, so I've grown up with an amount of fan service as you'd expect, but I notice it more and more the past 5-6 years than ever before because its somewhat exploded into popularity.

It seems we have similar backgrounds from that standpoint.

&gt;I think we hit a good middle ground honestly. Its not often on reddit you can discuss something without hurling abuse about

Completely agree. Great talking to you, and good luck on whatever development project you got going. "
"Full casters. I'm a huge fan of glass cannons and the like. As such, I prefer Sorcerers, Wizards, Warlocks, etc. and all their prestige and alternate-type classes. I grew up playing these types of games with my dad, who was either a paladin, big-ass fighter, or barbarian, so he always wanted a ranged fighter to help deal damage, and I always liked magic over physical prowess. 

This being said, I've been looking into Kineticist, so we'll see if I change a bit. "
"My game installed very quickly, that white bar before you even start the game you see in the PS menu. Yes because I figured the online servers are not online yet seeing as the game should not be out yet."
"At the risk of sounding like an asshole, isn't that kind of the point of having a new generation? Support for previous gens has to stop at some point. Can't really advance in the industry if you're still concerned with older technology.

Mortal Kombat 9 is on PS3/360. If you own an older system you have to get used to playing older games."
"That's kind of a weird song to defen. I mean, they literally said they hated generic pop (not that I don't love that song, but it isn't what most people who consider an example of ""the musical decline"")"
"Hmm, this may be a bit risky, but you could buy all the stuff first and then conduct a session with potential members. Then if they like the session and want to join the club, charge a membership fee. I don't know the college club that doesn't have a member fee. Usually like 15 dollars"
"Is there a UserVoice suggestion for it? If not, there should be. If we could get the votes of all the people who come to this sub, it would definitely make an impact. Now, I could create one and link to it here, but I don't want it to come off as some kind of voting scheme or anything."
"I couldn't agree more with your armor suggestions. Btw I am a huge fan of Army of One of the shotgun. So many times I have gotten a kill to juice my grenade recharge just in time for either a post-mortem or at the very least clutch chain damage.

edit: completely skipped over subclass design sections.... good work."

Once realized, we didn't let her have them alone, but N only escalated abuse towards the family, and eventually chaos ensued.  If I had realized when they were babies that N was still N-ing at others, I would not have let her near them.   I wish I had.

We raise ""family"" relationships to almost holiness in this country.  If it is a good family, yes, have relationships with them.  But if what they are going to teach your child is that the child is worthless, or to be selfish pigs like N, or any other nastiness, then RUN AWAY.  "

That's right, those of you playing at home, what if this movie is going to be ground work for a second movie to take us to central America to explore/destroy those temples? We know from Liberation that the Templar are excavating a Mayan temple in Mexico to find POE, so something has to push them in that direction, right? "

Even when he got his PC, I thought PC gaming was too expensive. However, I eventually caved. I found a prebuilt ASUS at Best Buy and picked it up. That was a huge regret.

"**Tired of League and wanna try out Dota 2? You just took the first step for a better gaming experience!**

**Here a short^^Kappa list of things you need to know.**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Avoid using League of Legends Terminology

* **Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA""** (CS:GO best ""MOBA"")
* Dota 2 is officially an ""ARTS"" 
* ""Hero"" not ""Champion""
* ""Tower"" not ""Turret""
* ""Creep"" not ""Minion""
* ""Barracks"" not ""Inhibitor""
* ""Ancient"" not ""Nexus"" (Wc3 = Tree and Throne)
* ""Roshan"" not ""Baron"" or ""Nashor""
* ""MMR"" not ""Elo"" (No, it's not the same. Elo = name of the ranking system named after it's creator, MMR = meaning of the shown value ""Match Making Rating"".)

Explanation why Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA"":

* DotA was made on Warcraft III which is an RTS game. Since DotA is basically a modified RTS game the genre was specified based on the genre of the original game, thus making it an ARTS. This is the logical name for it with a clear description and meaning behind it.
* The term ARTS was used before ""MOBA"" was even heard of, but wasn't used as much because DotA was the only game of this kind.
* Why ""MOBA"" doesn't even fit as a genre name: *What competitive game isn't multiplayer, online, and takes on some sort of battle? The first three words apply to nearly every single online game that pits players against each other (obviously). The fourth word, arena, doesn't even describe the DotA/LoL/HoN-genre. Using that word implies an all-hostile area that dismisses the territorial control and lane-pushing among its many facets of gameplay.*

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Before learning Dota 2

* Your rank in LoL doesn't matter when playing Dota 2.
* Don't apply your League habits to Dota 2.
* Be open for everything, there is more than one way to play.
* Your Dota 2 level does not matter and does not reflect your skill.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### General Information

* Every hero is available for everyone. (Different game modes might restrict which hero you can pick.)
* You have a courier which can bring items to you.
* Item's can be dropped, stashed, and some of them can be shared to other players.
* Compared to League, Dota 2 has many activatable items, most of them for utility purpose. 
* You lose gold when you die.
* All units have a turn rate. If you want to turn around with your hero you have to turn first before actually moving. It feels weird at first, but it's really easy to get used to.
* Micro - You move other units by selecting the units you want to move and not by Alt-click like in LoL. Meaning you can also deselect your hero unlike in LoL where your Champ is always selected.
* Mana management is very important. Spells costs way more than in LoL, but they have also a bigger impact when used correctly.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Denying Mechanic

* You can deny your own/allied units with an attack command (A-click).
* You can deny creeps (&lt;50% HP) to reduce the exp the enemy gets and obviously denying potential gold.
* You can deny heroes (&lt;25% HP) who have certain damage over time spells/debuffs on them.
* You can deny towers (&lt;10% HP) to reduce the gold the enemy team receives.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Runes

* Runes are special boosters which give you a certain effect depending on which rune you pick up.
* Runes spawn every 2 minutes on 2 locations on the river.
* There is always a Bounty rune and 1 random non-bounty rune. (Except for game start there are 2 Bounty Runes.)
* No non-bounty rune can spawn twice in a row.
* If a rune is not taken on a 2 minute mark, the rune will change.
* Runes can be stored inside of a Bottle and activated at will for up to 2 minutes before they activate automatically.
* After the rune is being from a Bottle, the Bottle will be refilled with 3 charges.

*The Runes:*

* **Bounty** - Gives 50 + (5 * minute) experience and 50 + (2 * minute) unreliable gold.
* **Double Damage** - Increases base attack damage by 100% for 45 seconds.
* **Haste** - Increases movement speed to 522 for 25 seconds and ignores all slow effects. Can be purged.
* **Illusion** - Spawns 2 illusions that last 75 seconds, and deal 35% damage. Melee take 200% damage, ranged take 300% damage.
* **Invisibility** - Grants invisibility after a 2 second fade time. Lasts 45 seconds.
* **Regeneration** - Grants 100 health regeneration and 67 mana regeneration per second for 30 seconds. Effect ends if hero takes damage, or when both health and mana are fully replenished.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Day/Night Cycle

* Game starts at 0:00 as day time, prior to that it's also day time.
* Every 4 minutes the game time changes (first night at 4:00).
* The game time affects the hero/creeps/building vision.
* Heroes have regular 1800 day vision and 800 night vision. There are exceptions.
* There are spells which affect the game time.
* Moon Shard grants you +250 night vision.
* Aghanim's Scepter for Keeper of the Light will give him unobstructed vision at day while Night Stalker gets unobstructed vision at night.


&amp;nbsp;
***
### Tower Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking a friendly hero with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking the tower itself with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking any friendly unit with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Circumstances for target switch:*

* If the targeted enemy unit or hero goes out of range
* If the targeted enemy unit or hero dies
* If an enemy unit or hero targets a friendly hero
* If an enemy hero being attacked by the tower manually attacks another enemy unit or hero (in which case, the tower will select a new target based on the above priority order).

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Creep Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy lane creeps
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Other behavior:*

* Ordering an attack on an enemy hero will change their aggro onto you.
* Lane creeps can follow you anywhere until they lose sight for a longer time or take aggro by other lane or neutral creeps.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Gameplay

* Dota 2 has no *forced* META like League which tells you to play in a certain way or to go on a certain lane.
* Many heroes can be played in many different ways. Called ""support"" doesn't always has to be a support, same as a ""carry"" can also be played as support. Considering you know what you're doing.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Common Tips

* If you play a hero with an invisibility spell or buy an item with such an ability, don't stand around waiting for an enemy to get low HP for an easy lasthit/kill. Scout the area, gain information and get kills or assist your team.
* Techies Stasis Trap and Remote Mines give vision! Spread them out! Gain vision! Take part in teamfights!

&amp;nbsp;
***
### MOST IMPORTANT

* **Last but not least: Always, and I mean ALWAYS! buy and carry a TP Scroll!!**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Useful Advanced Guides

* Making an *autoexec.cfg* with useful settings, commands and scripts. [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/2qivoy/xetus_dota_2_autoexeccfg/)
* Advanced HUD customization for colorblind (and everyone else). [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/389q68/guide_advanced_hud_customization_for_colorblind/)

&amp;nbsp;

*That's basically the main things you need to know. Just talk to people that you need some help, ask them what to do and be open for suggestions and tips.*

*If I forgot something tell me and I'll add it.*"
"Agreed but if we use the term delayed it would mean that most major console releases were delayed since they didn't have enough to meet demand. Using the term limited may also be a helpful marketing term that drives up interest due to the perception of scarcity.

HTC may still produce a lot and may be just be trying to cover their bases in case there are problems in manufacturing. I doubt they have an exact number of what will be available until they are made and pass quality control."
"Honestly, try spicebomb. I've used that for years amongst other colognes (margiela jazz club, tom Ford tobacco vanille, and CDG wonder wood) and have always gotten comments on how good it smells. Good masculine scent but not over bearing."
"It's odd to hear what I (and most of my friends) consider a feminist perspective to be spoken as a counter to a supposedly feminist point.

I fully agree with your perspective, but not your characterisation of feminism.

That's the issue with a lot of tumblr satire subs, you miss a lot of the more rational discourse simply by not seeing it.

Case in point, the first result on google for 'Feminist Sex Ed': http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/what_is_feminist_sex_education 

Emphasises consent and negative effects on men as well as women of poor sex ed, and characterises every feminist perspective I've encountered in the real world rather than online.

Sorry for the ramble, I just get rather concerned that the structure of reddit (and the bias of the default subs) lends itself to an unnecessarily adversarial perspective in regards to feminism.

In this scenario though aren't we talking about someone who used to LOVE Sushi and would talk about it and even get dressed up in Sushi-themed garb in order to enjoy it....Who then suddenly became a pro-fish activist?
"You can easily enjoy BF4 without premium (free night map update comes out September 1). Servers are full but there are many game modes that are dead.(the not fun ones) Premium mainly adds cool new maps, a few good guns and neat little features, I got it for $20 and I think it was worth it."
"From your screenshot; they're already installed. As long as they show up in your DATA folder they'll show up in MO.

They say 'unmanaged' on the left panel because they're in DATA rather than the MO directories, but that's normal. "
"&gt;If you found the gun itself at Zeleno (which is pleasantly surprising, actually), then maybe the ammo can spawn there, too.

"Jealous that she was allowed to have long hair, I was teasing my sister with some large scissors; vertically chomping them with my little 8 yr old arms bellowing in time with the snaps of the scissors, "" I'M going to CUT your HAAAAIR!""....She thoughtlessly grabbed for the scissors on ""HAAAAIR!"" and was sliced to the thumb bone on both sides. We, having no idea what to do and convinced we would both be disowned, tried wrapping the wound with toilet paper and applied some pressure( to keep blood coming out like one stops a leak in a dam). When the wound started dripping, I grabbed a handtowel and wailed for our parents. Mom took her to the ER AND I ""sat on the wall"" for hours convinced I was going to die when mom got home. It was a hard evening, but I was spared. I also try to avoid handing her a pair of scissors."
"I would like to interject with the only somewhat relevant comment that many of you guys on the fitness RP kick are obsessed with extreme fitness (ambition is great) and may be overdoing it on the supplements. You also want to consider the impact on your joints because one day you will be older and you still have to live in your body. Building muscle strength gradually but steadily will reduce your risk of injury.

If you do everything in proportion, you'll still be in the top 5% of game guys in a sea of pudgy manboobs, so don't screw up your long term health for short term gain. Let bitches play the short game and drive into the wall.

Every time read an article on protein the recommendation has gone up. Yes muscles are made of protein, but Your body doesn't need this much damn protein !  If your body doesn't use it all it it turns to ammonia in your frigging blood and it's a toxic load on your body before your kidneys take it out.

Creatine , T+ boosting herbals,wunderbar ! etc but are getting overused. I think these are icing on the cake. Again, if you take too much or take and skip your workout your fucking organs are going be stressed cleaning up this toxic soup at the end of the day.

Also I suspect a lot of people mugatu included take this stuff at the beginning of the day based on the workout they intend to do and don't get to half the time.

You want to take just enough to match your goals gain level, exertion level, you need to take breaks. More beyond this level is stressing your body out.

As (anecdotal single data point allegory)proof I offer the example my friend who trained hard for a endurance race type competition and came in first out of 1000 6 months ago. Combined with the paleo diet.

He's been out for the last month and a half passing kidney stones. Maybe this would be an acceptable trade off for greatness that will give him an alpha boost of poon so he can go die like a rutting moose, maybe it was unnecessary but look at *your* calendar realistically and other commitments decide whether your supplementation is going to get you there.

Mugatu says this out of love as he doesn't want to see you guys on dialysis. "
"Her passive gives her speed, percent health dmg and health back. Its very strong.


She also has HUGE chase potential, much like Riven. If you get a lead, its easy to chase people down because you have a dash, your passives move speed and your ult (which makes you faster around the people you ulted and gives you more opportunities to pop your passive). 

Not to mention her ult is ridiculous if you can manager to get it off.

Her W is kickass too, it reminds me yasuo's windwall. She becomes immune to incoming dmg, and if the dmg was a displacement she has potential to stun her opponent. 

Lots of outplay potential, health back and move speed. "
"actually, dkali is very useful on mono color teams, or more accurately, combo teams too. her unbindability + time extend awakenings are amazing. but it is her skill which makes her, in my opinion, the most versatile sub in the game. 6 turn cooldown board wipe which can be chained in conjunction with the likes of persephone or claire for extra damage. the active can be used for utility for a bind clear if given six hearts, or to stall out hits you otherwise would not be able to heal back up from.

lkali is a bit more limited i think."
On top of this there is also a Catholic Byzantine Empire. A unified Nubia going all the way to Egypt that is still Miaphystite. An Empire of Francia. An Empire of Carpathia that is Sunni. A Catholic Andalusia with a 6 year old Irish King. So much happens when you let everything run unchecked.
Because those sort of comments bring nothing of value to the comment section and people obviously does not like like them. The fact that you have multiple accounts (implying that you replied to your own comment?) doesn't change that fact.
"&gt;Please quote where I said ""We need the initiation of force to solve societal problems"".

Trying to weasel out huh? Statism requires the initiation of force. If you say we need taxes and fiat currency, you are saying we need the initiation of force. If you say we need a government monopoly on certain services, you are saying we need an initiation of force. 

Now justify why we need it. Stop being an idiot. "
"Yeah. I was at the watch party with a lot of my friends and I got so pissed off listening to these two ""fans"" in front of me talk shit about the team. They left with 15 minutes left in the third. When we tied it up, that entire crowd lost it. I was so nervous during that third intermission. I was anxiously dancing. When he scored that goal I about started crying. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen in the playoffs. That moment outdoes any other moment for me, hands down."
I think it's because there are more IT guys on reddit than alot of other occupations for say and there are just alot of people who carry across the US (and a few other countries) so you are bound to see more IT guys carrying as more IT guys post.  I am horrible at wording things but I hope that makes sense.
"I haven't seen any journal that accepts anything without a university or other institute adding their stamp on it, not even arXiv. The work is all my independent and original work, which is why I have an issue with people putting their name on it"
"If this is really for physics, just expand it in an infinite series and you have it easy.  The desire for ""expanded in elementary functions"" is not as helpful as it may seem - most of the important ""functional relationships"" you may look for have derivations using the infinite series.

Or even simpler, expand as an infinite exponential series using the standard geometric expansion of reciprocals.

This is a perfect example of a simple to integrate function that becomes much harder when you are focused on elementary expansions and the standard substitution and by-parts tricks of calculus.  Part of learning physics is learning to ignore all that unnecessary complication and just brute force the solution to make progress."

"Wish it were true-but there is also the category of those that are blatantly racist yet deny it, using the excuse ""Im not racist cos Im Liberal"". I've come across a disturbing number of feminists who claim to be Left wing who also are racist.

Political labels are used like fashion nowadays. But they rarely reflect the person who hides behind them anymore. "

"I don't think cultural libertarians are making any claims as to what a person can do with his property. Instead cultural libertarians are making a statement about the value of freedom of expression in culture and media. While the political libertarian defends the right of a road owner to refuse a political parade, the libertarian with a general support for human freedom, may still take the cultural libertarian perspective that it's good in general to let other people have their say.

Instead, all this did was make our gaming sessions frustrating and a source of tension. She did end up getting pretty good, but it's a miracle that she kept playing.

This also depends her personality: someone who plays games to achieve mastery and compete will respond better to coaching than someone who just wants to relax and goof around.

"which hype? That she would return in the show? I really really hoped she'd return at the end of the season before last - I thought it would have been a great way to keep the King in the North plot more relevant. The show went a totally different way in the end, and honestly I thought from that point onwards it was on a downward trend. The last season had very few 'great moments', regardless of whether it was coming from the books or D&amp;D. For me the finale this year felt so cheap; it was an old fashioned 'create as many cliff hangers as possible' ending. A glorious post from a few months back said that the show was becoming a parody of the books, and in that episode it definitely felt true. 

Sorry if that was too much of a downer - I'm still looking forward to the next season! The show can recover. "
"In the situation you describe you might get a few extra ones at most. Say you have 3 carpenters and have requested 10 barrels, you might end up with 12 barrels if all 3 were crafting the 10th one.

They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself.

The problem with that is that it's more analogous to having interrupts add a 3-6 second cooldown to every single weapon skill instead of 10 seconds to one.  There's not really an easy equivalent punishment for thieves since they depend so heavily on their initiative to survive.

"Speaking of the CDC, they also did research into gun violence and found the same conclusions.  Then, the NRA lobbyists convinced politicians through donations to get further research into gun violence completely banned.

That's pretty telling when a pro-gun group spends money to promote ignorance about gun statistics.

I'm actually quite happy with many of the smoking laws and ordinances that have been passed in the USA.  That's good progress.  I'm also happy the FDA just recently told Cigarette company to stop using labels like ""natural"" on the box.  I'm all for improving public health, and at least in the tobacco realm there has been good progress.  Back in Wisconsin, when I lived there years ago, I actually spent considerable time promoting and supporting causes that led to bans on smoking in places like restaurants, bars, and bowling alleys.  I suppose my family being involved in public health, social work, education, probably helped form me into someone who fights against things that harm people.  Not everyone shares my background.

I guess I'd wonder why someone would be opposed to reducing deaths.  I mean, even if there were stronger restrictions, but not an outright ban, would that not help?  Yet pro-gun people and groups are often vehemently opposed to more stringent background checks, mental health checks, and sales tracking.

If you paid attention, I support statistics, facts, and history of successes for being supportive of a government program designed to protect people.  This should have been a major clue that I do not, in fact, support unlimited government data collection, spying on citizens, and the patriot act.  I think the violations to people's freedoms and privacy are unconscionable in this case.

So while I do not support doing things ""by any means necessary"" but in fact support a fact based, prudent approach, I will continue to hold my stance that fewer Americans should be gun owners in an effort to reduce death from gunfire."

"My parents were die hard Michigan fans, so my first memories of Michigan football were from when I was about 7 years old in the late 80s. And for the longest time I didn't even realize Ohio St. was a significant rival. It sure seemed to me like the season opening game against Notre Dame was easily the biggest game of the year, an annual match up of two top-5 teams. The next biggest game was the Michigan St. game, because there were a decent chunk of my classmates who rooted for them. I didn't realize Ohio St. was any different than all the other Big Ten teams we beat every year on the way to the Rose Bowl until like 1993, when they were undefeated and highly ranked (and we still beat them). 

So, warning to Ohio St. fans: things can change."
"Yes! Well said :D

In addition to this, I feel the village aspect is largely unrecognized/not encouraged in the US society. I'm African-American and was ""raised in the church."" Beyond the 'brothers' and 'sisters' of my home church community (who were effectively mentors and surrogate family members), I was very close to my *actual* cousins, aunties, uncles, and grandparents. Family friends, which included neighbors, parents' co-workers, and my sister and I's close friends' families, also played a heavy and substantial role in my upbringing. Nevermind the teachers, teacher's aides, and other adult leaders of the many extracurricular activities I was involved in over the years. I don't understand how our (US) culture can encourage so many independent thoughts and beliefs to the exclusion of many potentially helpful voices when it comes to raising a *child*!

"Staying home is an individual decision. 

Staying with the person is your decision. 

It takes both of these things to have lived together as a one-income household.  If you don't want to be a one income household, leave. If you stay, you enabled and allowed the lifestyle to happen. 

The other person gets alimony if the lifestyle of a one income house hold was previously had. If you left, then there wasn't a one-income lifestyle, because a lifestyle requires living together.

"&gt;  Israel's hand ~~was always sent out for peace~~ they would like to not have every Arab nation trying to kill them an example being the 1948 war where the Arab league attacked and lost.

"&gt;Personally I'm all for her aborting the pregnancy but she shouldn't be able to abort the child in order to avoid it being tested to establish the her rape victim is the father though.

That is a kind of weird argument, isn't it? First off, I am quite sure a paternity test can be performed on an aborted fetus (sorry, that is a disgusting thing to write). Secondly, imagine being a child who was born in order to prove whether your mother raped your father — being a piece of evidence in a criminal case, so to speak. Can you imagine how such child must feel? It is shockingly unethical.

As for in general whether to take children away from rapist parents; I guess it must come down to individual cases. They would not necessarily be bad parents in *all* cases. The only argument that applies in *every* case would be  that parental cooperation would force the rape victim into persistent contact with their rapist, which we can't have, obviously."
"My assumption would be that as long as the dev community embraces Touch (i.e. allows their controls to be re-mapped for Touch) Oculus will simply replace their Rift + Xbone controller bundle with a Rift + Touch bundle, albeit at perhaps a higher price.  They'll possibly also have standalone Rifts at that point.

Came here to say that.  Glad to meet another fan.  Thinking about scheduling a trip to the UK to visit family in March as they will be there on tour and I could catch them in either Nottingham or Norwich.
"Make sure to bake keyframed moving elements in C4D. sometimes, interpolation between keyframes can be slightly different in C4D than Ae, making it out of sync. Also make sure framerates are correct. Do you use .AEC files?"
"I don't think intuition is categorically better than sensing. Sometimes you need a concrete focus on reality in life. I find sensors tend to be better than intuitives at doing careful and precise work, especially xSTx types. It's the xSFx types that, in my personal subjective opinion, are totally worthless human beings. Their biggest strength seems to be socially conforming obedience - strength through cohesive numbers.   "
"Well, I'm inclined to say: *why not both?* ;-)

I know what you're getting at, but provided you recognise experiences for what they are (peak and mundane it's all the same), then you are fully free to enjoy them, since you realise you *aren't* them fundamentally. That even includes having fun by being a bit of a dick in an argument now and again.

Perhaps it's not what you mean, but surely pursuits of power are only ""distractions"" if you think you are separate from the world and that one part will overcome the other? In exactly the same way as ""seeking"" is a distraction. So long as you don't mix up the narrative with some sort of ""development"" - you have understood that although you may change, you never progress - it's okay I reckon."

"Cause it is. Warcraft lore has always been hammy, but it hasn't been as outright lazy as it was in this expansion. It's really exemplified by Grom's sudden turn to heroic character at Hellfire Citadel, when the entire rest of the expansion he was The Threat that we were trying to kill. Like, I don't know how much you follow Game of Thrones, but if Ramsay Bolton decides to help out against the White Walkers you can sure as shit bet that Jon Snow isn't going to just pat him on the back when it's over. And yet how many atrocities did Grom's armies commit against the Draenei with zero provocation? And now everyone's cool? "
"They have pretty good vision actually. In water too with transparent eyelids. They even have great night vision with a layer behind their retinas called tapetum. There was a study in the 60s I read recently which indicated they may be severely farsighted while underwater, compensating with other senses to hunt prey. In open air their eyesight is just fine though as well as having super senses such as detecting pressure waves, temperature variations and chemical stimuli using dome pressure receptors which cover their entire body. In other words they are usually very aware animals of exactly what is going on. The reason I think these are blind is that they weren't able to see where the fish landed at all, they do use visual cues. Usually you can throw a piece of meat at them and they'll snatch it out of the air. "

You would deserve to have your child taken away from you if you let him live in such filth. Sorry but this guy is putrid. It's already animal abuse for your cats to be stuck with your trash husband and the literal dumpster he lives in.

Your statements about your husband being dealt a harsh lot in life and needing a gentle touch are just blah blah blah excuses. They are symptoms, not the problem, and you are contributing by enabling his garbage behavior.

This guy needs to fester in his own filth until he hits rock bottom enough, on his own, he has to better himself. As long as you clean his house and he just doesn't care if it's not clean, nothing will get better and your kid will have no respect for his slob dad. He'll probably never want to invite his friends over so they never see Jabba the Hutt slime trailing his way around the place and make fun of him.

A heart attack at 26? This guy is already dragging you down with him and will rot your life. Separate and tell him if he doesn't better himself and his living conditions, you will divorce in 6 months, 1 year, whatever.

I'm 21 now and since I lost my virginity at the age of 15, sex for the 'lulz and jizzing' is all I've really seen sex for. Upon listening to this show I've really had to think about my reproductive capacity in a new manner. I used believe the whole ""yea it's a biological reaction no different than a turd"" thing back in my 'edgy' teens (thank you extremely liberal upbringing). But even then I've always wanted to get a vasectomy and adopt a child instead which is causing me some internal conflict. I just can't justify creating a new child, not saying anyone is wrong for wanting to go forth with creating their own child as a couple, but I feel that if I can help an unwanted child I'd rather do that. The vasectomy would be to make sure that no pregnancies occur by mistake, but gives that me 'cum obsessed individual that's wasting their reproductive capacity' feel. The fact that I only want to adopt though reminds me that, technically, it'll be wasted anyways. 

Would really enjoy to hear your thoughts on this, and thanks a ton for doin whatcha do."

I haven't noticed a lot of improvement in my hip flexors, but that might also be because of a lack of core strength, or simply because I'm not consistent enough in doing the exercises."
"I understand that, but that being the case, there is no need to follow him, or imitate the Apostles as they imitated Christ.

"They need to go after Fortaleza quickly, and hopefully cut Brazil off from further northern expansion.

"A result of the virulent rivalry between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire over the control of Syrian territory surrounding Rafah, this conflict saw Ptolemy IV Philopator, the then Pharaoh of Egypt, battling against Antiochus III the Great. The North African Forest elephants used by Ptolemy IV charged towards their larger Asian cousins at the beginning of the fight but fell back not long after due to panic, causing a bit of disruption and confusion amongst the Egyptian infantrymen. In spite of this setback, the Egyptian phalanxes were able to drive back those of the Seleucids, while some of their cavalrymen pursued Antiochus, distracting him and thus preventing him from gathering his now retreating forces. This would lead to a Ptolemaic victory over the Seleucid Empire and temporary Egyptian control of the region, as well as the capture of the majority of Antiochus' Indian war elephants.

All else aside, this particular part of the Syrian Wars is especially notable for being the only known battle in history in which African war elephants have fought against their Asian counterparts."

As long as Overwatch nails a relatively simplistic class based shooter with a great competitive scene and really inventive and unrestrictive heroes, they can add neat twists later. "

"The basics? If you're an outsider, you're *not* welcome. You can spend 30 years in Denmark, speak fluent Danish and give no immediate tells that you're not Danish. When they find out, they *will* treat you differently. Well, the majority will. You'll still find open minded people who have no issues with foreigners. 

Also, they are far from the most social, friendly or service minded people you'll ever come across. I've been to Canada many times. Maybe only have a dozen or so, but I've collectively spent months of my time there. I've gotten to know a few Canadians through my trips. Life in Scandinavia is very, very far removed from life in Canada. 

I suggest finding a friend here where you can come and live with them for a short period of time and get to know the place before you decide to make a permanent move. These places can look great when you come for a week or two, but the more you learn about it, the less attractive it might seem.

Everyone is different and my experience of Denmark bares no relation on what your experience of moving to Sweden would be like, but you don't have to look far, even on here, to find Swedes who are as anti-foreigner as the Danes are. Most of the foreigners I've come across in all my years here tell a similar tale of unhappiness. The ones I know who came for work or women stay here, but I know countless people who came for work or study who just leave for somewhere better. Hell, I wouldn't be short of presenting a Dane or two who no longer wants to live here. It's not all rosy. There's *far* worse places that you could be that Canada. I've been in Scandinavia for 8 years and I'd still move to Canada tomorrow if the option presented itself."

"1. Cauldron works in mysterious and dickish ways. They honestly believe in forcing other people to make terrible sacrifices for the sake of their half-precognitive half-random-BS plans. So it's totally in character for them to let a murderer run wild if they think it's part of some path or other.

2. Cauldron is busy. Contessa doesn't have much free time.

3. Cauldron is very secretive. Acting too blatantly would compromise their plans, and maybe even force them to face consequences for all of the terrible stuff they've done.

4. Cauldron isn't invincible. Fanon builds Contessa up to be unstoppable, but she has weaknesses and blind spots. Cauldron's actual onscreen win/loss record isn't great. If Contessa went face-to-face with some parahumans, notably Jack, she might die.

Put it all together and you have a good explanation for Cauldron not targeting people like Mannequin. Chances are they do take out a fair number of murderous capes off-screen, but they've got a lot of reasons not to take out every cape that murders pointlessly."

She knows about it, I got the go ahead first. I was shocked it was happening and she's all, ""Thumbs Up!"" Our relationship is... interesting. 

For me personally, my attraction towards women has diminished. A fair bit of my previous attraction was a sort of visual arousal, but always with this strong undercurrent of, ""wish that was me!"" I'm not terribly shocked that's much lower and now men in the abstract generate more arousal for me than women in the abstract. There are things about guys that now turn me on much, much, more than they ever did. I've never actually been in a straight relationship with a man though."

"Snakes have two phalluses that are completely internal. They are actually totally inverted (inside out) when inside his vent (the cloacal hole that ejects waste in both sexes, and eggs in females), housed inside his body just before his tail starts. When they mate, the male will line his vent up with the female's and evert (turn right side out, so it sticks out of the vent and becomes engorged) one penis, which he then inserts into the female's vent, and transfers his sperm to her. Once he's done, his penis inverts again, inside his vent.

As for birds, their genitals are also internal, but I own snakes, not chickens, so am not up to date on their situation.

Incidentally, some snakes don't lay eggs, and have live births, instead."

"they should really go back to flag neutralization.     

i can see their point,  without flag neutralization,  if you want any chance of winning,  you have to go cap the flag.

with flag neutralization, there was a tendency for some players to leave the uncapped flag neutral and go on killing sprees.

this helps avoid that,  but at the same time, makes it harder to cap and get come from behind victories.

they should either increase the time to cap a flag to compensate for lack of neutralization,  i.e. when it fills up half way the speed of the cap doubles or triples,   or bring back neutralization.

i would prefer the time to be sped up drastically when the meters fills up half way, to make the games more enjoyable and increase the action.

"I was joking, but the last time they dropped out of the CL into the EL (or Uefa Cup as it was) that I remember (15 years or so ago) they went all the way to the final.

I seem to remember last year Wenger saying something along the lines of ""going out 3rd in your group is better than the last 16 as it allows you to continue to compete for a european trophy"" - which may have been him moaning about the situation, but also implies that he takes the EL seriously.

Any of the top 4 PL teams have the strength and depth to win the EL (not saying it's easy, but I definitely think all of our teams are capable of doing it), and doing so will boost the coefficient by a lot. 

"

You're competing with 3rd worlders who live worse then you and they do a better job and you're upset.

"&gt;What's worse is the housing crisis here is dreadful, Nobody can afford to rent, let alone buy. London is becoming the new monaco, and all the poor people are being pushed out into the home counties. We have no rent controls unlike NYC. Soon enough the infrastructure will completely break down as the cleaners, security guards, starbucks barristers and fast food workers just cannot afford to live here.  
  
This is the convenient fact that people arguing against rent control never want to address.  Where will the service workers live if you just let the market dictate rent with no controls?  My guess is the reason they all simply say something like ""they can live in the suburbs and commute"" is because no economist has to live on $15/hr.  Start paying economists low wages and watch those studies suddenly start championing rent controls.

I am not anxious about talking to people or showing off what I can do BUT whenever I play in front of others I feel my fingers being a bit more shaky and ""slow"". Usually doesn't happen with singing but I don't get a chance to show that off.

"I agree that mom is just using any excuse to control. But a  few friends of mine and myself have experienced headaches from being too close to a wifi antenna, whether it be on a router or a cell phone.

This is one of the reasons I use a wired headset."
"My boyfriend usually isn't emotionally open, but sometimes he does open up about things that bother or hurt him. I've always took it as a sign of closeness when he does open up.

"Actually, the more I think about it, I'm leaning towards an Impossible Girl 2: Electric Boogaloo scenario happening with Danny. 

His conscience was contained within a Matrix Slice (that's what the Nethersphere was) and we know that Gallifrey has survived in a supposedly inaccessible pocket dimension. What if the Nethersphere wasn't shutting down when he sent that final message - what if it was transmitting its stored data to the main Matrix on Gallifrey (or to the closest proxy - the TARDIS data core)? Missy would have been actively preventing this while working on it, since we see several scenes where she's plugged herself in to greet new arrivals personally. But after she was thwarted, nothing would have kept the slice from going through a regular maintenance cycle and attempting to upload the 'data'. After that point, Danny's a ghost in the machine, quite literally. The question then becomes, how does he get out?

We already know Danny has at least one descendent who looks just like him, and possibly more (it's unclear whether Kai Blue is a descendent of Danny Pink, but it's heavily implied, and we don't get a good look at him before he dies but he also superficially resembles Danny). If Danny was uploaded into Gallifrey's Matrix, it might be possible it has a similar effect on the time stream as when Clara threw herself into the Doctor's timeline.

Of course, I could just be heavily overthinking this whole thing, and the whole scenario is as simple as, ""The writers screwed up."""
"I think one factor people forget is that people are going to keep banning certain things until they get a feel on how to play against it. It's not so much it's op, it's that people haven't assembled strategies to counter it yet so it's hard to play against it.

That isn't always the case but it can make things look stronger than they really are. I do actually think Skarner/Garen do not fall under this case, but the rest do.

"I don't think that minimum wage is enough to support a family of four, nor do I think it was meant for that. Minimum wage is meant for getting on your feet. Then you move up from there. Raising the minimum wage is only going to hurt the people at and near the bottom because the prices for everything from the milk and bread you buy at the store to tvs at Best Buy all have the cost of labor built in. If you raise the minimum wage, you're just raising the poverty line with it. The benefits of having more money are relegated by higher commodity prices. "

"Yeah, caster Jinx is about doing absurd damage with W + R (GB, LW, ER, Lucidity, Muramana). :)

I think the main issue is going to be your build path. Standard build can spike in DPS after one item (IE), while this build takes 2-3 items to really get going. I could possibly see this working in a super passive game where there's a ton of farming involved, but if you're behind, this build is going to take too long to ramp up, and if you're ahead, you're missing out on an early power spike to solidify that lead.

I do love this idea though. The BotRK + Runaan's synergy is always nice when the enemy has a team that likes to clump, especially with the splash on Fishbones. 

However, from your math, it looks like you need to have three targets to outpace a standard build in raw DPS. Raw DPS isn't the be-all-end-all, though, since you want to be prioritizing your damage. Killing one enemy champion faster is preferable to dealing more damage to two, I think, since a dead champion can't output DPS or CC: we need to look at the opportunity cost and relative team DPS. When you eliminate a source of DPS or CC, your team gains an advantage. This is why assassins can be incredibly valuable to a team: a dead champion doesn't contribute to their team. So while your DPS on three targets may be higher, the enemy team's DPS is relatively higher since your damage is spread out and enemies can live a bit longer.

That being said, a team that thrives on sustained fights would love an AoE Jinx I think. A Karma for team shields, an Orianna to pull people into Jinx's Runaan's range, a couple strong tanky initiators (Wu, Zac, Sej, Amumu, etc.), and you've got a nice looking team that doesn't have to worry too much about protecting Jinx since she's at max rocket range.

With the way League has been going with its patches, we may start to see Marksman become more of a supporting DPS role that facilitates other roles to shine (perhaps the rise of Runaan's Ashe to aid juggernauts!)."

"I'll second this. Follow the link in /u/TheFallenPhoenix's post for some really solid information regarding your BOFF ability layouts. 

As a primary Eclipse pilot myself I would endorse flying a Beam Array setup. It's easier to keep enemies on your side than in front of the Eclipse and should give you a boost to your overall average dps; though it is all in your preferred play style and preference.

I'm not sure how your faction reputations look but as already said, replacing most of your consoles with fleet/rep consoles is a solid step towards higher dps. 

Browsing some of the builds on this subreddit can also give you a good idea of where to gear towards."

"Most likely, Boots. Clean, sturdy, boots. High heels accentuate femininity, sturdy boots accentuate the masculinity. Mainly because they impress an aura of power.

"""The term ""adverse possession,” sometimes referred to as ""squatter's rights,"" refers to a situation where title to real property is acquired without compensation by virtue of open and continuous use of the property in a manner conflicting with the true owner's rights for a specified length of time.  In the example above, though you didn’t pay anything extra for the partial lot, your use of the property conflicted with your neighbor’s use of the property for several years.  You adversely possessed his property"""
"I would try to get as reliable a RB as you can in the first round, because they are going to be more valuable, and later RBs have too many question marks to rely on.

I mean, I got my wisdom teeth pulled out about a week ago. All we use in my country is local anesthesia, my jaw was numb for couple of hours but I was good to drive home straigth from the dentist by myself. Didn't even have much pain afterwards and only took one painkiller at the evening.

Was this some bigger operation or what?

"Follow up question. Why did God have to send his son to die to forgive our sins in the first place? Why not just forgive all sins and be done with it?

Also from what I know about God and satan, god seems to be much more evil than satan. God killed nearly everyone on earth in the flood and sends angels to kill people, while satan pretty much only chose to worship himself which really doesn't sound bad in any context. Do you think that satan might actually be god and god (satan) has tricked us into following his word so that he would have more followers?"
"If you want to put in extra work, there are a bunch of things with rebates. You just have to send them in after you buy it. For example, if patience is a virtue, I got 16GB of DDR3 RAM for $20. There were sold separately with mcafee antivirus. You have to install mcaffee on a computer and send in confirmation code with the rebate. So I bought two, one for me and in my fiancé's name and shipped to two different addresses. Got them and created a system restore point, then installed the mcaffee to get the code. I had to sign up for mcaffee auto renew and give a credit card, so I bought two prepaid cards and used those. I got and then Submitted the code into their rebate system and once I got confirmation, I restored to the previous point so that shitty software wasn't on my computer. Did that with another old computer I had and got two rebates, $70 each. This my RAM was $20. 

My fiancé doesn't think it was worth all that effort. "
"The Giftcard/Serve process is a pain but spending to get the point bonus is like free money. Usually you can get $2-400 of value/statement credits per credit card.

"This scenario did not make me change my mind about humans instantly as you're implying, nor do I judge the actions of one person to represent everyone. I was rather implying it is becoming more evident in our society and that bothers me as a Canadian. You're right, humans can act like pieces of garbage, and you could surely agree it is only getting worse... I've seen the good sides of humanity too, as I work in Health Care. My point is, why can't we strive for it to always be getting better and try to fix what is broken.

I think it's moronic to say ""deal with it"". It's that type of lazy attitude that allows this type of behaviour to be pushed further in the direction of ""normal"" in our society, rather than saying let's do something about it. Imagine if you were the victim of someone yelling for you to go back to your country and that he was going to murder your children. Maybe in the future you won't be so quick to attack but rather ask for clarity."
"I was in a single car accident and was almost pronounced dead.  My dad and I were moving to another state answer had been driving almost 14 hours when I fell asleep and drove straight into a stoplight pole at 55mph.  A nurse was driving behind me on her way to work.  She told me later that she was the first to reach me and I didn't have a pulse for at least 5 minutes.  She said my dad came running back to my car and she told him I was dead.  She said he started yelling my name and I suddenly woke up.

TL;DR I wrecked a car, didn't have a pulse for over 5 minutes, my dad yelled my name, I woke up."
"Use a pair of clippers to get it close, then I use a generic Gillette knockoff razor from Sam's. I shave my head in the shower, start by washing with normal body wash or bar soap, which i prefer. After it's clean, get some cream and lather that shit. Now, grab the razor, and starting from the middle of  your forehead, start shaving over your head. Just go straight back, up and over. To give you a midline. Pick a side you want to shave first, and start moving the razor closer to that side when you start your next pass. I use my off hand to align the razor with the midline of my last pass. Do this for both sides. 

For the back of your head and neck, i like to go up along my spine and then to the sides, same procedure as for the top, align the razor, and take each half at a time. Be careful around the ears, i usually add more cream, and shave toward the ear, cut myself too many times trying to start at the ear and go away. Check the ears when you're done and out of the shower. Its easy to miss some hair by the junction with the side burns.

Once you think you are done, wash off the cream and wash your head again with some kind of mild soap. Bar soap works well here... I use dial. If you use aftershave, go for it. I'm a cheap grad student, and i just put some 70%isopropyl alcohol on my palms, and slick my skull with that. Don't cry, let it evaporate, and then put some moisturizer on your nice and smooth head.

Final step, feel badass."

"It's a way to make things difficult, but a terrible way, to say the least.

There are challenging things you can do better and better with practice, like GWD solo Woox style prayer flicking, Zulrah by memorizing the rotations and the correct times to eat etc. and even at smoke devil boss you can practice walking in the correct way to not miss ticks and to get hit as few times as possible.

My problem is in how my eyes see colors differently as a result of repeated retina surgeries, and I can't overcome this with practice. I'm currently doing Cerberus with an eye patch over my left eye. It somewhat fixes the problem for me, but for actually colorblind people or just others with issues similar to mine this kind of thing is just not good gameplay.

Besides, I bet some non-Jagex client could just add overlay melee, range and mage icons on the ghosts, completely negating any ""difficulty"" gained with this type of design."

Nothing that isn't coming to all systems anyways."
"Mida will still have its uses IMO. The movement perk alone almost outweighs the damage shortcomings it might have going into y2.

I also don't doubt that there will be other armor or weapons that will have speed perks on them at some point. We've now got burn resist armors coming our way, so anything is possible. Bungie also loves reusing stuff. I've noticed hammer forged has returned as a perk with tTK, something that was removed with HoW. "

Jenner Benner told me. Cultural backwater: It's not New York City Brisbane? Yes Brisbane. Cultural backwater now with brackenwater? Yes Brackenwater. Over a 6-7 year period, 45,000 millionaire chinekes from China were allowed to immigrate to Canada (100% ended up in Vancouver). A city with a 610,000 person population, overrun by psychopathic millionaire chinekes. The idea was that these arriving Asians would provide jobs and prop up the economy with their wealth. Nah. They use Vancouver to launder money. The city sees none of the cash outside of the initial home buy. Guess who pays higher taxes in Vancouver: The Chineke with 12.3 million in the bank, or the Canadian living outside the city? It's the Canadian who can't afford to life in chinekes central (Vancouver). Hint: The Chineke millionaires pay less taxes than refugees.

BUT SYDNEY? YES LIKE SYDNEY. BC is a chineKe owned money laundering operation. In 30 years when you will only find chinekes faces who can't speak English in the city of Vancouver, I will laugh. And while all of this is going on, not a single policitian will do a consensus to determine what portion of the Vancouver and immediate surrounding areas is Chinekes or Chinekes owned. Fucking pathetic, Canada bowing down and fucking its own citizens over to make a bunch of Chinekes millionaires (and billionaires) happy, all for a few scraps of a couple thousand per millionaire.

"You do realize that the dinosaur depicted in Jurassic Park is the *Pachycephalosaurus,* which sounds like ""Paki"" but isn't based on a racial slur? Translated, it means ""thick headed lizard."" 

There *is* a species of dinosaur known scientifically as the *Pakisaurus* because its fossils were discovered in Pakistan. Dinosaurs are often named after the places where they were first discovered. For example, the *Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis* was named after the Mamenchi Ferry station where it was first found, as well as the Hochuan County where the second one was found. As FFGFM pointed out, the Nigersaurus was named after Niger, where it was originally found.

&gt; Yes, it very much did, which is why the gun crime rates have dropped so clearly over the last decade or so.

Gun crime rates dropped just as fast in the US over the past 20 years, and it's not because there are fewer on the streets.

You seemed to think they are connected.

&gt; aaand here it is. Why do you think that I want to completely ban weapons in the US? Seriously, why do you think that? I'm curious.

This whole thread has been about you praising the effectiveness of Australian gun bans. I didn't say completely ban weapons, I was looking at a ban comprable to what australia did, on some types. If you don't think we should enact that sort of legislation in the US why did you bring up australia in the first place?

"The cold is exhilarating. Whereas the summer heat is exhausting. I get this rush of energy and excitement when I step out into cold weather. Sometimes when I'm shivering I literally scream. I don't know... I think my adrenaline just really gets going.

I also sleep much better in cooler temps. In the summer I'm constantly tossing and turning trying to find the cold side of the bed. I try to keep from blasting the AC but I have 2 fans pointing directly at my bed, I sleep naked, and when it gets to be too unbearable I keep a spray bottle of water nearby to provide some temporary relief. When you get to a point where nothing is helping it's absolute torture. 

In the winter I just layer up on blankets, wear clothes to bed and I'm good. If I'm getting too warm I just roll over to a cold spot or remove a layer. If I'm too cold I add another layer. My bed isn't drenched in sweat and tears of frustration. "

"The Phoneix isnt just a luxury yacht like Ben and many other CIG employees have said over and over again.. I dont understand why people are still trying to spread this false rumor.

Heck even the luxury super yach 890 has a battle bridge and has been described as being a very viable command and control / captial ship in battles for small/medium sized orgs."
"I have to disagree with you for one reason alone: I recently discovered the label ""Dream Catalogue"" which seems to promote and identify itself with Vaporwave. However, I've found the music on this label to be infinitely more evocative, skillfully made, original and creative than the material most associate with the genre. That low-pitched, sample-intensive mall jazz style is completely abandoned in favor of ambient and surreal soundscapes that evoke naturalistic and dream-like imagery. It's a little more akin with the work of Oneohtrix Point Never in the sense that it abandons traditional structure for atmosphere and sonic exploration.

[2 8 1 4](https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--18) is a good place to start - this project is a collaboration between telepath and Hong Kong Express, two ""vaporwave"" artists with discographies of their own. The album feels and sounds similar to the cover art - drifting into sleep by a rainy window exposing a neon-soaked Tokyo night in the future. This album was created entirely without samples - all of the sounds are original, and the atmosphere is immense. It's best absorbed as a whole (like all the releases on Dream Catalogue) but the sixth and final tracks are particularly special. The last track uses sounds of flowing water as a percussive instrument, accompanied by hi-hats tuned to resemble something like crickets on a lake. 

[CHESSMASTER](https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--23) also had an excellent release on this label very recently. Rather than drifting into sleep, this album evokes being fully surrounded and swallowed in a surreal, eerie dream. If you could soundtrack the soul of a sentient machine, it would sound something like this album. The ninth track features wild percussion and drum sequencing, while the second track, like many on this album, utilizes vocal samples to create ice-cold atmosphere rather than melodic refrains.

The entire label's discography can be streamed and downloaded for free, and there's plenty more worth discovering on that bandcamp alone. ""Overgrowth"" feels like an empty and still forrest throughout, while the earlier CHESSMASTER album ""Angel"" skips between one overwhelming wall of sound to the next, with a pace so breakneck and overstuffed with ideas that it reminds me of a ambient Madvillainy.

Discovering this label lead to the realization that there is plenty of inspired and creative music that's labeled as ""vaporwave"" - a great example on the opposite end of the spectrum is [Blank Banshee,](https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/venus-death-trap) who fuses elements of trip-hop, jazz, chiptune and vaporwave in his favor. He doesn't sound entirely unlike Flying Lotus mashed with the sonic palette of a 1990s Windows startup disc. Hell, [the guy even sampled Donkey Kong Country](https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/eco-zones) tastefully in his newest project."

"Congrats on the feature!

Organize by scene and cut one scene at a time. I make 3 timelines per scene to start:

* “s01_stringout” - all the clips for that scene in shooting order
* “s01_selects” - a culled version of the stringout timeline with stuff that could potentially make it in the finished movie
* “s01_rev01” - a cut of the scene

Once you feel good about each scene on its own, start assembling reels. A feature is too long to work with on a single timeline. NLE performance, sharing with sound/color, exporting–all benefit from smaller chunks. Reels are a helpful way to break the movie up into more digestible pieces. Typically a reel is about 15-20 minutes long. 

Within each reel is where you can start making your scenes start to flow together. At this point, if you need to rework a scene, you can either just edit directly inside each reel or return to the scene timelines and cut new versions in. I find it gets confusing going back and forth, so once I bust into reel mode I usually stay there. Sometimes you want the flexibility of a less cluttered timeline though. Whatever works for you.

Set the timecode of each reel to reflect each reel number and put a 10 second countdown at the head with a 2 pop. Reel 01’s first frame of picture would be 01:00:00;00, Reel 02 would be 02:00:00;00, etc. 

This is the same with shorts, but be mindful of your audio tracks. Take whatever the most number of tracks recorded per clip is and treat that as an individual layer. So for example if your clips have at most 8 channels of audio, treat tracks 1-8 as one layer and if you have to overlap audio, use tracks 9-16. Designate consistent channels for SFX and music as well. Be consistent from reel to reel and your mixer will love you. 

There’s more stuff I’m forgetting, but hopefully that’s a helpful start. In general, organization is paramount. It's the same with shorts, but at the scale of a feature sloppiness can quickly get unmanageable, so do your best to work clean and you'll have a good time!"
"&gt;So is this 'women love assholes' line a rationalisation of the fact the girl you like rejected you 'she rejected me for him, but that's ok, he is just an asshole'

No. Asshole behavior is correlated with other behavior that women find attractive such as confidence and sexual forwardness. Asshole behavior works far better than pedestalization and beta orbiting, for instance: 

&gt;One day you pluck up the courage

LOL, fail. 

On the other hand, me taking first dates on a walk as an excuse to physically escalate, without getting explicit enthusiastic consent, leads to fuck-closing them on a regular basis. Not texting back because I'm out with other women, not changing my plans to meet their needs, being unavailable at times, leads to them becoming plates. In other words, by adopting the behaviors of a natural (a Chad), behaviors that my former beta self would dub assholish, I have multiple women wanting to fuck me. 

So am I an asshole? Think before you answer, 'cause the women like the new me...."

"If, 1000 people who make tanks are laid off and 1000 different people (who had been looking for work) were employed in that district building roads, schools, hospitals, etc. unemployment hasn't increased.

"FreeNAS operates fine without ECC. It does exactly the same thing with or without. 

**However**, and this is the big point, your data isn't fully protected without ECC. This is because FreeNAS/ZFS does most of it's operations in ram (thus the larger ram requirements over non-ZFS solutions) - so things like read/write, scrubbing, parity, snapshots...all the things that make ZFS great. Because it does those things in ram, it means that any errors in ram that go uncorrected can and probably will be written to disk, and thus have a chance of corrupting your data. When this happens in normal operation (ie playing a game or watching a video), it's not a big deal, as the worst that happens is you get a crash, and most of the time the system just recalculates and corrects it. Not so in file systems, where the damage can be real and permanent.

The main problem here, and what ECC is designed to address, is [bit-flips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error). That's when an electrical or magnetic field (ie radiation) causes a 0 to turn to a 1 or visa versa. Because it comes from an outside source, your computer has no idea that it's happened and will just continue on with the error in place, which is bad if you're a file system. What ECC does is add an extra layer to the process, wherein a parity chip (an actual extra chip on the ram) is used to ""double check"" the 1s and 0s and make sure they're right. That's why ECC is generally considered slower than non-ECC ram, because it's having to check everything before returning values (though as fast as ram is these days, the difference isn't something you'll notice). So ECC is generally preferred over non-ECC for ZFS, to prevent these errors from propagating into your file system.

That said, the chances of bit-flips are relatively low. They're generally caused by stuff like cosmic rays and radiation. For instance, a white paper from the International Space Station showed an average of 840 bit-flips a day due to cosmic rays. Without ECC ram being used, there's a good chance the whole thing would have crashed and burned due to an unrecoverable error...pretty good use of ECC there. On the other hand, down here where we're shielded by the atmosphere and don't have a high degree of background radiation (unless you live by Chernobel, then you'll need ECC for sure), bit-flips are a rare and illusive thing. One study from a large datacenter showed that in about 7 years, the manager identified 3 bit-flips for sure, and a handful of others that may or may not have been. I've personally run FreeNAS for a good long time without ECC and never once had an error. So you might be fine. You'll probably be fine. But you won't be 100% fine without ECC.

Bottom line, if what you're storing is important, irreplaceable data, get ECC, full stop. For my work machines, I run ECC, because it's worth the extra security. If it's a bunch of stuff you downloaded off the internet and can download again, get ECC to save you the trouble in the rare chance that a problem occurs, if your budget allows. If your budget doesn't allow, don't let lack of ECC stop you from running FreeNAS, if that's what you want to run.

&gt; I have read that ECC is not totally necessary but is better for ZFS. I think.

tl;dr - it's not necessary, but it's a good idea if your budget allows it."
"Everyone knows my point is the truth. there's a difference between legitimately really mean things, and trash-talk on games.

"If you ever come across [Händlmaier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4ndlmaier) sweet mustard, give it a try. It's one of, if not *the* best store bought sweet mustards I've ever had. It goes well with Leberkäse, a lot of sausages, and meat dishes but it also complements creamy, nutty cheeses very well. You want to get really weird? Try a breakfast roll (Brötchen) with peanut butter, Gruyère cheese and a dab of sweet mustard. Krensenf / Meerrettichsenf (mustard with horseradish) is not very popular around here (I'm a purebred north german Klippschieter), we prefer Dijon mustards in medium hot and hot. Kremser, Bautz'ner and Düsseldorfer are also nice and go very well with Bock- und Bratwurst. I... think I have to go eat something now. Something with mustard."

"I guess saying they aren't a real threat was too much, but I don't like their odds to take the division over the Hawks. I know it may seem brash but here me out. 

The Cardinals got totally fucked by injures to their QB's last year, it's true, really bad luck in that regard. but they also had (0.7/g) point differential for the season, 16th in the league (compared to (8.8/g) SEA 2nd in the league) They were in a lot close games that could have gone either way, mainly thanks to their 5th ranked defense. A defense that I believe over preformed talent wise and who also just lost their DC.

To rival the Hawks they will need Carson to be healthy for a full season this year and preforming well, which unfortunately given his health throughout his career and Arians style of offense is no guarantee.

This is starting to go long but I'll point out some things on the flip side, Seattle had a terrible first half of the season and if it weren't for us winning 10 in a row we could have missed the playoffs. I don't see that kind of start happening again, our offense was neutered by a revolving door of o-linemen, including playing 4 centers throughout the season, all while trying to incorporate the disaster that was Percy Harvin into our offense. Even though our line is no where the leagues best, it looks way more promising than what we had last season. we've added Gram and our wide receiving core has improved (no way they could be worse than last season). 

Our defense has a good chance at being able to match what they have done the last three seasons or be close, especially with a pass rush that looks more like the dominant one in our super bowl winning season than last year.

 I am obviously biased but I do acknowledge the Cards are the biggest competition in the division and could end up taking it, but on paper I think we are a much more talented team. 
You never know what's going to happen any given sunday and throughout a season but I believe we should be heavy favorites for the division at this point. "

"Addiction in general is largely characterized by two factors (and I suspect as time goes on, a third - genetics - will be identified):

1. An inability to stop in the face of mounting consequences. 
2. A tendency to escalate the behavior (the addiction becomes more and more intense as tolerance builds). 

OP's boyfriend hasn't seen any mounting circumstances yet. And who knows if there's been an escalating factor. 

So yes, it's possible that it could be addiction, but there's insufficient info here to be anywhere certain of that. 

Also I think your timeline is a touch out there. Once a week or once every three months? The Kinsey Institute (www.iub.edu/~kinsey/resources/faq.html) reports that among undergraduate students (i.e. OP's age) men masturbate an average of 12 times per month. Of that same grouping, those with partners engaged in sexual activity weekly or more at a rate of 75%.

If you're pissed off at someone, hearing ""Have another drink and drive yourself home / I hope there's ice on all the roads / And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt / And again when your head goes through the windshield,"" is great to yell at the top of your lungs."
"I've never experienced this myself but it sounds interesting.  I have seen all sorts of things but I've never gone to other planes before.

"Some random guy at Walmart started talking to me about this endurance race he was training for. He was obviously a little ""weird"", but he was a nice guy so I talked with him for a good 10mins.

"&gt; [Harry] had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway.  
...  
""Let's go,"" called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps.  ""This isn't right, Harry, come on, let's go. . . .""  
She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it...  
...  
[Harry] had just heard something.  There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil.  
""What are you saying?"" he said very loudly, so that the words echoed all around the surrounding stone benches.  
""Nobody's talking, Harry!"" said Hermione, now moving over to him.  
...  
""I can hear them too,"" breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil.  ""There are people *in there*!""  
""What do you mean, '*in there*'?"" demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted.  ""There isn't any '*in there*,' it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there -- Harry, stop it, come away --""  
...  
""Sirius,"" Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continuously swaying veil.  
...  
On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too.  Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm, Ron Neville's, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.  
""What d'you reckon that arch was?"" Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room.  
""I don't know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,"" she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.

Just last week I saw a post of a developer that thought there was chat implemented into the game for users to be able to type to one another.

It is this kind of development that will run this game into the ground, just like every other attempt at this genre...."

The closer the wire segment is to the power source, the more current it will have to carry.

"As said below you have contingencies and a placement stop plan.  I'm a civil engineer working at a major US project with many mass concrete placements - several of which have taken 20 hours or more.  On a job like this (and the one I'm working) they'll have an onsite batch plant so the placement rate will be dictated by the pump rate and batch plant capacity.  You have plans in place for a lot of different contingencies (loss of power at the batch plant, extra drivers, extra trucks, extra pumps, how to handle various failures, etc) but if it all goes to shit, you might have to just stop placing concrete.

A typical plan for that (for instance, plan B and plan C and whatever fail) on my project is to use what concrete you have left
to level out the surface, then roughen the surface in the same manner as the planned construction joints.  At that point you have to go back to the design engineer and find out if that unplanned construction joint is acceptable or not (if it's not, you might have to excavate out the concrete and re-place portions).

What you don't do, however, is keep placing on top of a cold joint.  If you have a cold joint (and the concrete placement crews will *know* they have a cold joint - trust me.  If you somehow forgot to come back around and the concrete sets up beyond being able to get it back alive with vibration, you stop the placement as described above."

"We settled with Insightly. We liked it because it's not expensive (depending on what version you buy), because it can integrate with our stock/order system, and because of the google sidebar app. 

We tried it for the free trial period. It came down to Salesforce, Insightly, and Base CRM. Salesforce said it was overkill, Base CRM's email tool wasn't very functional plus it didn't have an app that linked in with gmail, and Insightly won out for the reasons I stated above. "
"A concealed weapon isn't really for getting into shootouts in public. It's more for being able to defend yourself if someone threatens you with a knife or their bare hands. Most people aren't trained to fight like Marines, so a gun would be their only means of defense. For example, a woman who is being stalked by an ex boyfriend that is walking back home after work."
"I always liked computer games over console games, right from the beginning.

I paid for and installed it all by myself. The first real computer I build was from spare computer parts at the college I attended. It had a pentium 4 processor, 1GB of ram, and no video card. I didn't have enough money for a new computer, and I wanted one for papers and stuff. Junior year I bought a Lenovo Y470 laptop and consider this to be my ascension. Three years later I built the computer above.

"not really necessary as long as you pay attention to the map and understand your limitations.  Morello+athenes is strong though, its not maximizing early/mid damage, but come late game its worth it.

The thing about veigar is that he is a late game carry who mauls people, however, he is still impactful in the mid game due to his scaling, ult, and Huge CC ability.  

Normally, morello and athenes is somewhat wasteful as you are not maximizing your damage, but remember, veigar with 40% cdr is terrifying.  You can easily stack 50-100 ap to make up for whatever damage bonus you get with other weapons.

"&gt; The perpetuation of misogyny requires men to internalize certain ideas that are harmful to themselves, therefore ending endemic misogyny would be beneficial to men.

This is a convenient reframing of men's issues as mere side-effects of women's issues.

Men's issues have little to do with misogyny. They are due to the lack of empathy for men, the assumption of male hyperagency, the punishment of gender non-conforming men and perpetuation of negative stereotypes of men.

You have demonstrated why I don't believe that feminism can help men. 

When feminists acknowledge men's issues, most of them do so only to promote the idea women are oppressed. Everything men suffer is simply evidence of their domination of women.

Most of the rhetoric from feminism displays complete obliviousness to the social forces which harm men. This work frames everything as power imbalance (always with men holding more power) and misogyny. Men's issues don't fit this model (I""d arge that many women's issues don't either but that's a different discussion). If you can't comprehend the real causes of the problem you can't really address it."

"Texan here! I literally went from not knowing how to use a gun to having passed the CHL written/shooting requirements in 8 hours. The background check didn't take long, and I literally had my license in my hand maybe a month after learning how to shoot. 

**THIS IS A PROBLEM!**

**Background:** my dad was a gun smith, and I literally grew up around guns (like most Texans). I was never particularly interested in guns, and my father never forced me to shoot one; he did require that I learn that guns need to be respected, and I should never touch one without proper training from him or someone else. I had no interest; so, I never touched a gun. When he died unexpectedly I felt incredibly guilty because teaching his darling girls to shoot was something he always wanted to do. I miss him everyday and getting a CHL was something I wanted to do to honor him. The instructor held two classes one after the other: a beginning class (people who have never touched a gun before) and a CHL certification class. I felt good after taking the class and meeting the requirements but didn't touch another gun for months. My birthday came around, and my mother wanted to buy me a gun for protection. I had a CHL; so I thought it was a good idea. I had a freaking break down in the store when I couldn't pull the gun open (I knew the terminology when I took the test, but that was a while ago) to check the chamber/load it. I still do not own a gun and will not until I get more training. The moral of this story is not what a stupid girl I am. It is that no one SHOULD be able to own a gun without proper training. Not just 8 hours. I mean a lot of training. Guns are a way of life in Texas, and I acknowledge that many people grow up with proper training. Maybe we should blame the guy who certified me because I clearly was not ready - well I did score the highest in the class at the shooting range...but still. I do not feel good about how easy it was for me (or how easy it will be for other unqualified citizens) to get a CHL."

"Well, a significant reason why Chelsea in particular, has not bothered to try to promote youth enough, is because they have been shuffling managers for the last decade, so it's hard to develop these players when each manager will rate the players differently. For instance, McEachran was played a lot under Ancelotti, and then he was never given a chance in the first team after that. "
"I think you're a little bit misinformed about how this works. Having smaller amount of teams that can compete is actually bigger advantage since points divide less. Points of Italian teams divide for 6 teams, and for England for 8 teams, so England gets lesser points for same win.

 Look at this, if Italian team wins a game in CL groupstage against some opponent they'll get more points for Italy than if English team does the same."
"Feel like this chapter went a little too far with the ""Rules don't apply to you if you're good and heroic"" schtick.

It was one thing when it was just passing an entrance exam. He had what the school was looking for so they made an exception over his test score. It happens.

This though. If there are laws doing hero work without the appropriate training, then this is exactly the sort of situation those laws are designed for. A more qualified hero would've apprehended the criminal without hospitalizing him, or at least followed proper protocol so that everybody knew Stain's injuries were unavoidable.

Most grievously of all, there were numerous properly trained heroes on hand throughout the whole fiasko. Iida was on duty, down the street from his mentor's base of operations. They surely have proper protocol for when one of their heroes in training finds their supervisor has been taken out. Deku had to leave Gran Torino in order to go chasing after the crime scene he suspected was in progress. Then, conveniently was only able to contact even more untrained aspiring heroes for reinforcement. Todoroki then left Endeavor behind to chase after his friend's distress signal.

Because every step of the way they chose to tackle this problem without supervision we ended up with this act of vigilante brutality.

Endeavor likely should be penalized too, for allowing a student under his supervision to just bugger off like that.

By this standard the laws around superheroism don't even matter at all. Sure, it says you're not supposed to do hero work unless you're properly trained, but the act of doing hero work also provides a get out of jail free card exempting you from any laws you may be breaking in the process, even if you're clearly exactly why those laws exist in the first place."
"Nice job copying and pasting the definition off google

Thats a very vague phrase and difficult to interpret, 

When they say ""would not normally commit"" its not exclusive to a cop walking up to a random person on the street and the cop asking him to sell his crack and offering him a percent of the profit  

it can be an actual drug dealer being asked by a cop to sell his crack for a percent of the profit too.  

when they say ""not normally commit"" it means that the person didn't walk out their door and say ""Im gonna go call someone to sell me a sellable amount of crack today"" "

"I don't know. To me, your response just sounds like a re-hash of the same argument that I've already heard. By and large, of course. the first paragraph of it does bring something new to the problem of evil debate which I haven't heard.

Let's take a look at the purpose of Original Sin. This response seems to contend that Original Sin exists to purify us and make us worthy of heaven. An obstacle to overcome. However, when God first created man, we WERE worthy of heaven. There was never a need to purify us. It's only after the apple incident that we had to worry about Original Sin.

"Gotta disagree.  I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure how the ""rape as entertainment"" is portrayed. However one of the biggest YA series of the last year centered around a world that annually sent children into an arena to fight to the death, so it's not as if complex themes aren't explored in YA.

That said, even if we dislike her book or the subject matter, her larger message about queer diversity in fantasy is valid and worth reading."
"It bothered me too because I was excited to see his daughter and hear about dad-James, but I'm guessing that his daughter is staying with her mother, and since they are exes who knows what their relationship is like.

"I'm not gonna get into whether or not Crawford is an average goalie because in my mind that's one of those fun sports debates where both sides have a real case for their positions. That being said, average goalies can totally win the Jennings. Especially when you take into account that two goalies on the same team often win together, so long as they both hit the minimum GP requirement. Halak has one, Roman Turek has two, hell the first time Crawford won it Ray Emery was also included as a winner. It's also worth noting that even the definition of the award says ""the goaltender(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it ... based on regular-season play."" Team is right there in the criteria. 

I don't know whether you're right or wrong, but if it was me making the case for Crawford's excellence, I wouldn't use the Jennings as the lynchpin of my argument.

"Sometimes u/myvirginityisstrong, when a man and a woman love one another very dearly they do ""grown up stuff."" That can mean a lot of things. For instance, a woman may ask a man to shit on her chest and sit in it. We call that a Cleveland steamer. Fire a load into it and you've got yourself a delectable Boston cream-pie! And sometimes a man will ask an aggressive woman in high heels to stomp on his testicles repeatedly in order to achieve the ultimate climax. These things are just part of the natural progression of the human cycle of sexual fantasy, and must be regarded as such. I hope I've cleared things up for ya, little feller!"
"it doesn't really. A normal hero with 200 Attack speed requires 200 IAS to double their dps, assuming they don't have any extra attacks (e.g. Moment of Courage). Weaver with 200 Attack speed requires 260 IAS to double his overall dps.

whereas both weaver and a Juggernaut will require 150 damage to double their dps if their current attack damage is 150.

It's not that IAS is bad on weaver it's just not as efficient as it is on other heroes whereas attack damage still is."

"There is nothing wrong with RNG posts other than they do nothing for anyone. 
We have deduced there are hot zones for summoning, random number generators are actually a myth to some degree according to this theory.
What needs to be done to benefit the community would be creating an additional locked subforum consisting of 24 threads alone, 1 for each hour in the day. Perhaps even 24 per day of the week, which have not been tested by us. Within the threads will contain members postings of their summons inside each respective time stamp, rather than just spamming the dokkan forum with a bunch of useless screenshots.
From this we can further isolate the hot zones and rule out the inaccuracies within the theory, as much as possible as while rng is not completely random, it still is not an exact science. 
The trends we have noticed are the ssj goku appearing for sr and ssr pulls tend to mostly happen around the korin tower windows, early in the day then late in the evening. There could be more..but to find them we would need a massive amount of contributors as well as the rerollers adding their ss of when ssj appears to do their summoning in addition to when the standard black haired goku grants similar luck. This will also aid in ensuring rerollers waste less time.
Many of you will disagree with everything stated here while having minimal experience in the subject, which is fine. You can continue believing there are no trends within your rngesus system. The informed among us will continue summoning at the right time to get decent pulls while you will continue stocking up on Rs. I wont be responding to any stupid questions or ignorant comments, this info and proposal is for you. Ive used all my stones already and wont be making another account. 
Lastly, in regards to your concern over the dokkan sub feeling dead, perhaps if this idea Ive proposed takes off then rng related posts will still be prevalent within the sub while all the rngesus screenshots and discussion of will be in an appropriate seperate sub within this sub. I dont even know how possible that is under this coding, just a mere idea to give all dokkan players an edge or heightened chance of pulling really good cards. That end result is all that really matters, everything else was just the system I feel would work most efficiently to achieve that goal."

"**241. Margaret Bobonich, Guatemala (13th)**

So, Margie B plays a fairly important role in the pre-merge of Guatemala. Because this is one of the most brutal seasons ever, they kick things off with an overnight 11-mile hike, which is gruelling on basically everyone, especially the Nakum tribe. Blake gets sick from poison ivy, Bobby Jon collapsed, Judd got extremely sick and Jim tore his bicep, so Margaret, a nurse is able to help the tribe with the injuries sustained from the hike, helping them win the reward of a shelter.

After that, Margaret's story tapers off a bit until we get to the swap, where Rafe, Steph, Jamie and Lydia go over to join Margaret, Brooke, Cindy and Judd. However, since Judd wasn't secure with his old tribemates, he flips to join the Yaxha's quickly and votes out Brooke, which displeases Marge.

Then we get the next episode, which is a fantastic episode and I'll fight anyone about that. We get the reward challenge where Judd manages to almost single-handedly win reward for his tribe, which was a barbecue with beer. As a result, Judd has a few beers before heading to the double tribal, and the Nakum tribal is probably a top 10 tribal, maybe top 5. Because Margaret is now on the chopping block, she decides to needle Judd throughout the day and tribal in an attempt to cause him to blow up and turn the rest of the tribe against him. To the audience's benefit, he does blow up and sticks his foot in his mouth at least three times. Unfortunately for Margie B, this isn't enough and she goes home, but not without a great confessional:

&gt; Judd... you're a bully, you're self-righteous, you're rude, you're profane. And, for all those reasons, you've probably gotten this far. However, no one like you deserves a million dollars. My vote's for you, buddy.

"Again, see the context of the discussion to understand. The commenter essentially said this was not an individual right. I pointed out the driving mechanism behind the amendment; i.e. what is needed to understand it. Without the fear of a disarmed populace, there is no reason to have the second amendment.

I am not asking the U.S. to send troops, but some weapons would be nice. But, the E.U. (not including the EU) has no obligation to help Ukraine and I understand why they won't.

"Most of our students don't have an interest in working at a studio as engineers. We are more artist-based and artist focused. What I would suggest is to make sure this is what you want to do, because it's very different than being an artist/producer. A lot of young artists get fooled thinking because it's in the studio, it's closer to their goals. But working on other people's music is a completely different perspective than creating your own. However, if you do want to go to a studio, the main thing they are looking for is hunger. You have to be willing to do anything at any time. Hunger will always progress your status in the pack. 
It's been awesome to see Jauz' rise and how quick it's happened, along with all the students out there following their dreams.

It's mean, it's fast, it's super easy to learn and it's a blast!"
"I started back this past Monday and I was overwhelmed. 

My online class was a bit scattered (new instructor is new to the University) but I think it's going to even out over the next two weeks.

The classroom class was frustrating after having been in the job market. So many distracting questions and jokes when all I wanted was to get the material, understand it, and get out of there at a reasonable time. 

Instead, I grew impatient with jokes/questions asking about mandatory attendance, what was going to be on exams (specifics), requests for extra credit ""just because"" and other crap. I forgot how much of a pain in the ass young people can be (when I was one of them.) 

**Best advice** - study that syllabus and get as far ahead as you can manage. Don't let the workload get ahead of you. Waiting until the last minute will cause stress and impact your grade. You're an adult now- this is your new job. Plan accordingly and deliver the best performance possible. "
hey man regals are a super good hookah brand. i have 3 of them myself. and the owner who i have personal talked to is always very helpful he made me a custom blue regal about a year ago. i can send a pic if you want to see the condition of them i have noticed that the ball valves are inconsistent but besides that they are the best 10/10 for sure.

"I don't disagree that women face discrimination in this country, but i believe there is a lot of extreme feminism in this country right now and thats what scares me. It scares me to see people getting riled up about misconstrued facts, because of what they may have experience. You can see this happening with the Black Lives matter group as well. Both groups i support, but when you start perpetuating the thing that you denounce, then you are causing nothing but chaos"
"I'm not associated with Elcomsoft, but I came across this just now and didn't find any mention of this backdoor on reddit at all, let alone on /r/netsec.

"a while ago I made a list of people who would be affected by my death. the list had 3 poeple on it. the list has since been shortened to just 1 person, him.

he is my only friend and the only person who I will ever love. without him i have nothing. and i dont see a point in suffering the rest of my life without him."

"They have low-yield nuclear devices, and they have ballistic missiles.  The one in your photo is, I believe, the Taepo Dong II missile, which has a fairly respectable range.  The problem North Korea has is making their nuclear devices small enough to fit into these missiles.  There is no evidence that NK has been able to do that, but they have tested nuclear devices in 2006, 2009, and 2013, each time getting it better and better.  It's only a matter of time before the threat becomes credible."
"I haven't watched the ending for a while, but I've always thought people misread that line. It isn't ""the created will always rebel against their creators"" as in ""all created will always rebel against their creators"", it's ""it will always be the case that the created rebel against their creators"".

The difference being that there isn't actually any contradiction between what the Catalyst is saying and any individual case of synthetics cooperating with their creators."

"Dude, exactly. There is close to zero character development or characterization in video games outside of cliches, because  they are meant for the player to self-insert. The plot and themes are also bare-bones because they are only a vehicle for the gameplay. Could you imagine how boring and predictable it would be watching Borderlands 2 in theatres for example? Sure some writers and good actors could make it better, but why not use that talent for more creative or original stuff?"

"&gt; is a status quo they're okay with, and the HL is dying inside.

The concept that the LL is happy carefree and the HL is the only one suffering is not correct in every case (but I see a lot of that opinion here). I have a much lower libido than average and I ALWAYS am just as miserable as my HL partners. There is guilt for not being able to provide. Pain when they experience the pain of rejection. Misery during ""maintenance sex."" More often than not, the LL person is suffering just as much.

&gt; There are plenty of posts of HLs trying everything they can think of, and there's no change. The LL just doesn't want sex.

It would be great if we could get a matching post from the spouse each time someone accounted ""their side"" of the relationship. Frustration often leads to misunderstanding or misrepresentation of another's point of view. 

&gt; I'm sure it isn't. How often would there be sex if it was up to you, as the LL, in the absence of whining etc. Do you think whining happens where both sides are having sex as often as they want, +/-25%?

This difference will vary widely based on why someone is LL, but here's the response from my POV. I masturbate about twice a week so I would say my libido is around there. 

But if I'm laying in bed with my partner and they initiate sex without me being horny, and I refuse and they whine, then whining isn't going to make me horny. It's going to irritate me. It's going to make me lose a level of respect for my partner. Now I've lost respect for my partner, and I'm not aroused, and the next time they proposition sex, the cycle repeats. So this cycle continues where the HL partner is hurt by the constant refusal, and I'm turned off by the whining. The only thing to be gained by whining and pestering is annoyance from the person on the receiving end - a completely unproductive response. 

Instead, if my partner initiates and I refuse, I would much prefer that they take it without whining. It doesn't justify the DB problem, it doesn't mean that the HL is giving in, but it means that the HL person isn't adding annoyance because of the whining on top of the problems that already exist. "
"I agree. The problem with Vive fanboys (not Vive fans) is that their own subforum(s) activity is slow, almost dead on some days and weeks. They have multiple subforums and it's still slow.

"I agree with this, unfortunately even questions that can be answered easily with one or two verses (and include the verses) will include many more verses out of context. 

I asked a question regarding landmarkism and they really didn't provide much in the realm of sources, and the book they did recommend for ""recommended reading"" was given an abysmal rating on Amazon. 

I chalk it up to the large number of questions that need answered, but that's kinda the point. Having proper answers is critical; and with no real Greek (or Hebrew) included, it suffers at times."
"Obviously with HiRez we should all take the 'continuing support' bit with a ~~grain~~ brick of salt, but its nice to hear that that is being mentioned as apart of this update. Even if its a really small team, at this point I'd just take any amount of dedicated resources as a win."
"First off I see that you have Hart in goal. While he is probably going to be one of the most stalwart keepers in the league, it takes up one of those 3 valuable City spaces which could be much better invested in defence. I recommend Kolarov (now that Clichy is out he will be first-choice for the next 6-8 weeks) or Kompany (pretty much nailed on each week bar injury/suspension). I would recommend replacing Hart with either Mignolet (who has a decent run of home games coming up) or Courtois (who is a decent pick even if his fixtures aren't jaw-dropping). So, moving on to defence I would reccomend swapping out Cedric for the City defender as his upcoming fixtures aren't that good. Midfield looks good although I would swap out Silva for Yaya who is cheaper and will probably get more points **in the near future** than Silva. Albrighton is a bit meh but I suspect he is just in there to save funds. If this is the case then there are also alternative differentials such as Nathan Redmond who has got at least 6 points in every one of his first 3 games. Front line looks decent but try swapping out Pelle for one of Gomis, Benteke or Lukaku as they are going to continue their scoring in the coming weeks. Lastly on the subs you should try swapping out Hennessey for McCarthy as Hennessey will not start. This may not matter that much as Speroni is coming back soon but it is not good to have a non-starter in case hart is injured/suspended.

Of course, none of these changes should be made this week unless you are WCing but try to spread them out over the next couple of weeks.

Hope I could help!"
"But you're comparing *growth*. In the year 2000, Microsoft had less room to grow than the average company in the Nasdaq/SP500/wever.

"One problem you might be facing is the ""support rule"" in the matchmaking: If one team has a support, the other one will have a support as well. That is a big issue for Tyrande and Tassadar since they are both a bit (or a bit more) weak on the healing side and healing is stronger than other support-y stuff. So if you're solo-supporting as Tyrande against a Malfurion, he'll simply negate all of your team's damage while their team's damage is pretty much permanent since you cannot keep up with the healing.

To mitigate this problem you have two options from which one is pretty great and the other one an excuse of a workaround... First, try queueing with a ""real"" healer. This leaves you open for the utility support role. Uther seems to be a great pick since you both have good burst heal and supplement each other with just more healing. I've also successfully run a Tyrande/Malfurion combo because Tyrande can make up for the lack of burst healing (at least a bit) and Malf just delivers the raw healing power of his heals over time. With this setup you are able to excel at zoning, stunning, making vulnerable and adding dps while your team still does not lack healing power.

The workaround is to take healing talents and try to be a healer. It'll not be perfect by far, but you can out-heal Uther's Q after lvl13. He'll still have his W and R in addition to that and out-heal you in total, but you can at least make your team compete: With overflowing light she does very similar healing (just about 25 HP less healing at lvl20) on an 8 sec cooldown compared to Uther's Q at 12 sec for half (or even a third if you took celestial attunement) of the mana-cost. Additionally she can take battle momentum, lowering her cooldowns so that she can spam her Q like nobody's business (if she was constantly attacking the cooldown would be around 5 sec). It'll most certainly not make you the best healer in the world, but your team might have a fighting chance - and all only a the cost of 2-3 talent choices, leaving the other tiers for boosting that utility you bring to the table."

1) When I have found caches without a pen in it and I didn't bring one along or if the log is full and I don't have any to replace it with, I have taken a picture of me holding the cache as ""proof"" of the find before but I generally try to avoid doing so on ones that I can easily come back to another day.

2) I rarely find swag I like but still tend to bring bags of mcdonald's toys and random trinkets I find at Goodwill/garage sales or make and leave them without taking anything. When I do actually take something, I personally don't feel as bad with equal exchange since I'm generally filling caches up with stuff for others to find more often than not. For whatever it's worth, cool rocks and minerals are generally something I would trade out for.

"It's true, we don't know if all gem tech is made from sentient gems. Pearl claims that Lapis was found by the galaxy warp, so unless she was lying (she could be), lapis was trapped by homeworld after being poofed and cracked. If pearl was lying, then yes, lapis was a PoW. 

Lapis described her time in the mirror as work, when steven asked, so she clearly saw it as slavery. Then again, she talked about being trapped later, so I suppose it's like prison and slavery at the same time! What fun!

As far as varieties of gems, that still only adds up to thousands of gems total. I suppose that's possible, considering how powerful gems are. But it also begs the question, why would they need to colonize other worlds, then? Why build the kindergartens, when one world could easily sustain them. Because a few thousand life forms that don't eat or breathe could sustain themselves on one world forever.

The pyro will deal normal hit damage, but you instantly end the afterburn, which means they can then re-ignite your allies, which you can then extinguish, and so on.

Whilst your allies are competent enough, you can farm the shit out of failed pyro attacks. Even long range afterburn damage such as from flare guns and the cow mangler can be turned into massive damage potential."

"Canada has a very small population. If we are 10th in the world, then our jobs created per capita from the production of motor vehicles, is probably much higher than that. 

The cost of cars to the consumer will likely not be significant. They might go down a little bit, but the car companies will continue to charge what canadians are willing to pay. 

If the prices drop significantly, and profits don't increase, then the only real advantage that the companies would have in doing so would be creating domestic jobs, which is probably not something they are terribly interested in, particularly as it will incur a cost in infrastructure, and also wages will go up slightly, as job supply increases and worker supply remains constant. 

So, the companies must be planning significant profit increases which will be greater than the cost in the long run. That means your cars probably won't be cheaper, and canadians will have less money to purchase them with, as per the lack of the money multiplier from lack of jobs, and money in the hands of canadians. 

You have to be very careful with trade agreements. There are many factors that come into play. There is depletion of resources, the future, jobs, all of that stuff. 

But you want a good flow of exports and imports. It's pretty tricky. 

I think producing cars here is better for canadians, all other things being equal. I am not familiar with the details of the TPP though, to have much of an opinion on the rest of it. It could very well be that losing jobs in that market might be worth it. Perhaps we might decide to fund projects that can make use of the skilled labour, and unskilled labour experience in those fields, and our economy will profit from other clauses in the agreement. 

It is complex. For things like this, you want a government you can trust, that will look at all the options correctly, that you don't have to rely on canadians looking at every detail. 

I don't think we have one of those right now. I don't trust Harper at all. But not wanting car production to leave the country is actually sensible imo.

* It boots in less than 30 seconds (on a regular HDD)

* The main speakers and headphone jack were seperated into 2 different sound devices (they were merged before). I like to use some bass boost (included with Windows sound enhancements) on my earbuds, but when I unplugged them, the main speakers would just sound quieter. With 2 devices, the effect now only applies to the headphones, while the main speakers remain at full volume, without having to toggle it on and off all the time

"I'm angry SJWs have coopted the name and sullied it. It makes it all 100x harder for anyone to take ""feminists"" seriously. I mentioned this in a comment earlier but I feel a lot of people (both genders) are confused about what ""equality"" means.

Feminists just want the autonomy to make decisions about themselves. The gender roles thing gets thrown around a lot but all it *should* mean is that if a woman focuses on her career you don't have people shaming her for not having a family. Similarly, if a man chooses to be a SAHD people should be ok with that and not make him feel emasculated.

Of course it runs deep but if there were one thing I could really get out there is that feminism is less about *specific* inequalities but *general* inequalities. With the wage gap it's not that a male doctor gets paid 13 cents more on the dollar, it's the fact that the low paying jobs are typically female-oriented careers. It's not that feminists think all men are rapists in waiting, just that we want more respect for things other than our bodies and appearance. How many idiotic articles have you seen talking about some female politician's sex appeal? Far too many. It gets old."

"**Credit:** FenrisOrson

**God:** Chang'e

**Role:** Preferably mid, but solo can work

**Starter:** Vamp Shroud (You want to keep the extra 700 gold)

**Build:** CDR Boots&gt; Book of Thoth&gt; Breastplate if Valor&gt; Lotus Crown&gt; Rod of Tahuti &gt; Spear of the Magus

**Actives:** Greater Blink, Purification Beads

**Summary:** The strategy of this build is to get Chang'e to mid/late game where she thrives. You start with just Vamp Shroud and keep the 700 gold in hand, once you have 800 gold (you should have this much after clearing red) use your bunny to buy Soul Stone. This build is more about survivability and sustain as opposed to straight burst, hence the 40% CDR and double defensive items. Blink is key so that you can initiate a team fight or counter initiate. 

**Situational Items:** 
1. CDR Boots can be swapped with Pen Boots at your discretion
2. Chronos Pendant and BoV are interchangeable 
3. Lotus Crown can be swapped for any defensive/utility item. Divine Ruin, Gem of Iso and Ethereal Staff are all nice options
4. Spear of the Magus can be swapped with Obsidian Shard, Void Stone or Soul Reaver, any of these can work"

"Honesty, when LoTR was made Peter Jackson hated the idea of a traditional wizard magic fight. He's said so openly in behind the scenes interviews.

For example, he really wanted the Saruman vs Gandalf fight to be more like two old men beating the shit out of eachother, instead of a flashy wizards' duel.

"Well, it's interesting, I guess, because effective patient care requires patient cooperation, so it puts us as physicians immediately at odds with some patients who either don't wish to discuss their weight or reject out of hand discussions of obesity that imply that they were somehow responsible (some, not all, lots of overweight patients are plenty happy to agree). The truth of it is that obesity in and of itself is not a disease state if you want to split hairs, just like hypertension (high blood pressure) isn't a disease either (for sake of simplicity) but instead they are markers and risk factors of disease. This puts us in a bind, however, because people don't just have a disease called ""heart attacks,"" so we gather up all the data that tells us such-and-such quantitative data tells us this observable metric is predictive of the disease you're actually worried about.

They're right in the sense that it is certainly possible that an overweight person does not, in a strict sense, die from being overweight, much like on a day to day basis, smoking a cigarette will not cause your death unless you catch yourself on fire. Compare that to, say, drug overdoses that directly cause death, which are a much easier teaching example. It devolves into a debate on semantics, sometimes, but a lot of times we make certain compromises to keep patients in the fold since it is better having them get regular care even if they're not fully compliant. That's something that honestly could have been a positive perspective of the ""healthy at any size"" movement like ""don't give up on these recommendations just because you're severely overweight,"" because really, how easy would be it be to justify completely giving up once you're already 100lbs overweight? What's a little more? Even when you cut back heavily and you stop the out of control gaining but end up reaching equilibrium where you now are maintaining the weight, it creates a feeling that your efforts to resist what is by then a trained response to overeat are going to waste. I've read some papers that suggest that the hormonal regulation takes something like three to six months to reach a new ""normal,"" which is a lot longer than most diets last. "
"Did he claim the front door was ajar, or that he had reason to believe someone was in immediate danger? Absent a warrant, or actively chasing a suspect, that would be the only reason law enforcement can enter your home without permission. And while it's certainly possible your door wasn't actually ajar, and he did not hear anything indicating someone was in trouble, you can bet that's probably what he's going to claim. 

You can contact your local sheriff's department to find out precisely why he entered, and file a complaint against the deputy.

"Man kann sich natürlich vorstellen, wie Österreich aussehen würde, wenn sich die Bevölkerung in den letzten 30 Jahren verdoppelt hätte. Der Punkt ist: Das war aber nicht der Fall. Stattdessen haben Leute in Nachfolge Hans Kelsens ein politisches System geschaffen, das die Stabilität des Landes sicherstellt. Wer sich nebenbei darüber beschwert, dass die Länder politischen Einfluss haben sollte bedenken, aus welchen Gründen ihnen dieser Einfluss zugestanden wurde. 

Das Video ist zwar ganz nett und schön, ignoriert aber zwei wesentliche Punkte. Erstens: Österreich hat ebenso wie andere europäische Staaten keine Verantwortung dafür, dass Staaten mit gewissen gesellschaftlichen Merkmalen nicht so recht zu funktionieren scheinen. Es läge an diesen Staaten selbst, diese Merkmale in einem Säkularisierungsprozess abzulegen. Zweitens: Staaten und Gesellschaften können gegen eine kaum begrenzte Zuwanderung sein, vor allem, wenn fraglich ist, inwieweit die Zuwanderer die Grundwerte des Staats teilen."

Likewise with Chris Christie.

"It doesn't change the fact that rushing QBs get devalued in 6 pt per TD leagues. The overall rushing matters because when you have a large chunk of your points coming from rushing that stays static while the portion from your passing TDs goes up 40-80 points.

Here's a chart I made:

http://i.imgur.com/zrf3uhe.png

As you can see in the % Difference column, pocket passers improve a lot more in 6pt per TD leagues than rushing QBs do. All I'm saying is when you're drafting for a 6 point per TD league you need to devalue rushing QBs in your rankings."
"&gt; Chinese government fans nationalistic hatred towards Japan whenever there's domestic turmoil.

This was not the case in the 1990s. In fact, a lot of people did not know Japanese Emperor Akihito paid friendly visit only to one foreign country, that was China in 1992 (or 1994 I can not remember). People also forgot in the early days when HK people visit Diaoyu island, the Chinese government was trying to discourage that type of behaviors.


The America bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, is the single most important event that changed balance in Chinese government. From 1999 it is a different world in both West and China.


That being said, I think the only long term solution is to establish trust among Chinese-Japanese-American people and build the relation based on friendship and mutual understanding and respect. They will always be competitors to some degree, that does not mean they have to be enemies. "

"You know what, you are *absolutely* right; that is an utterly FANTASTIC idea. Let's all hate the same people who risk their lives every single day to uphold the country's laws and to do their very best to keep the innocent safe while under ever-constant scrutiny from tens of millions of strangers - many who don't even live in the U.S., might I add - who flip their shit and instantly believe that every cop/agent we have is a corrupt, power-abusive asshole the very moment that just one or two of their peers out of over 1 million sworn in total do something bad (I say the word ""strangers"" because people who know most police officers have respect for what they do due to the fact that they understand what their job really entails). People who, might I add, probably have never been in the shoes of a law enforcement officer and can even fathom how demanding of a job they have, and say that we should record every little thing they do 24/7 to be the watch dogs of our nation because we have some sort of fascist police force secretly running our country and oppressing us. I realize it's the cool and trendy thing nowadays to hate cops and say ""fuck the police"" like you're N.W.A back in 1988 or something, but at some point you may decide to grow up and put on your big boy pants when you realize that that kind of attitude is the one that gets you in legal trouble when you refuse to cooperate with the men and women who, at any point in time, can decide to just up and quit their jobs and may not be there to save your sorry ass one day when you're in mortal danger.

Oh yeah, and one more thing: the overall majority of people who are shot and killed by policemen/women are the morons who do something incredibly stupid like coming at them with a weapon even or get into a shootout with them after they've been warned multiple times to drop it and get down on the ground or face the consequences, because that's the standard procedure for dealing with a deadly suspect. If you really hate cops so much and want to do something about it, why don't you just grab the largest steak knife from your kitchen, charge at the first cop you see in your neighborhood and let me know how that works out for you when you wake up in the hospital with a nice, shiny nine-millimeter bullet in your chest after you've been shot in self-defense and an awesome felony charge waiting for you in court for the attempted murder of a law enforcement official (if they don't actually kill you first for being a complete dumbass like they should, that is). Or, even better, try living in a place like Mexico where the majority of cops and their superiors actually *are* corrupt and won't even give you a warning before they break into your home and kill you and your whole family in your sleep because you managed to piss off someone in the Mexican government who's been paid off by the drug cartels that practically run the whole damn country."

"No mention of that in the [Fate SRD](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects) either. My guess is that they got it mixed up when writing the cheat sheet (the next option they cover is increasing the difficulty of a source of passive opposition), and the card's text was probably copied from the former.

I would say: go ahead and spend any points you want against active opposition; just remember the rest of the rules, like not invoking the same aspect twice unless one of those invocations is free."
"Let's bring back Black and White bathrooms. Why bother letting women vote?

"You're on the right path. As for myself, and all my producer friends, we started on a demo of Fruity Loops, knew nothing about anything, and 12 years later we are making decent music. 

I was a kid, so I didn't understand the scope of what goes into production, nor did I really care. We were all having fun. It would have been *really* helpful to have some basic foundation skills in music theory, keyboard mechanics, and signal flow/manipulation. So, again, it seems like you're on the right path, haha. But a lot of us started out haphazardly and have made it to the point we're at from every different angle. The most important thing is to find the balance between enjoyment and work ethic. I'm 12 years deep into production and I've learned over time that if I'm even kinda not feeling it, then I need to stop and try something else otherwise I'm going to get shoddy results. 

Do some studying now to get the basics, but write as much music as you can while you have a young mind for it. Even if it's crap, which it undoubtedly will be haha, you'll learn a lot from just going through the reps and finding for yourself what sounds good and what doesn't. 

Whenever you hit writer's block, that's your time to hit the books like a champ. Study your DAW and synth manuals, learn the ins-and-outs of compression and filtering, brush up on your music theory, etc. 

Once you get some basic mixing skills (basic understanding of leveling, EQ, compression, and delay/reverb), pick up Mike Senior's Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio and read that through a couple times. I'm on my third. It really opened my eyes to a whole new world to mixing that is absolutely essential for getting past the amateur bedroom producer sound. The progression through the book is fantastic and digestible, while being written very well and not a total drag to read like most production texts. It's also pretty funny.

"Here is Elon Musk's rationale explained:
&gt;Let’s look at it another way. Let’s imagine the Earth is a hard drive, and each species on Earth, including our own, is a Microsoft Excel document on the hard drive filled with trillions of rows of data. Using our shortened timescale, where 50 million years = one month, here’s what we know:

Right now, it’s August of 2015
The hard drive (i.e. the Earth) came into existence 7.5 years ago, in early 2008
A year ago, in August of 2014, the hard drive was loaded up with Excel documents (i.e. the origin of animals). Since then, new Excel docs have been continually created and others have developed an error message and stopped opening (i.e gone extinct).
Since August 2014, the hard drive has crashed five times—i.e. extinction events—in November 2014, in December 2014, in March 2015, April 2015, and July 2015. Each time the hard drive crashed, it rebooted a few hours later, but after rebooting, about 70% of the Excel docs were no longer there. Except the March 2015 crash, which erased 95% of the documents.
Now it’s mid-August 2015, and the homo sapiens Excel doc was created about two hours ago.
Now—if you owned a hard drive with an extraordinarily important Excel doc on it, and you knew that the hard drive pretty reliably tended to crash every month or two, with the last crash happening five weeks ago—what’s the very obvious thing you’d do?

You’d copy the document onto a second hard drive.

That’s why Elon Musk wants to put a million people on Mars.

"Try Tequatl the Sunless in Sparkfly Fen if you haven't already. Personally I find it not that difficult (I've done hills defense and zerg), it's just a matter of organization - but it's still a fun experience and a step up from the starting area world bosses like Shadow Behemoth, Svanir Shaman, and so on.

After that, the Triple Trouble Evolved Jungle Wurm in Bloodtide Coast is (by my understanding) the most challenging world boss in the game. And again, I believe (though I've never tried it) that it's mostly a matter of organization and knowing the mechanics.

I know everyone's hoping for instanced Challenging Group Content(TM) - and I am as well - but I'm hoping HoT also brings some new 'hardcore' world bosses as well as an overhaul of the old ones. Even a return to pre-nerf Tequatl would be nice."

"I feel like some 1960's psychedelic aesthetic was influenced by it. It's probably my favorite art movement anyway... it's almost sci-fi seeming. -Also, I can't help but wonder if some drugs played a role in that style... maybe the 1920s prohibitions had some effect on design styles.

"I expect that you and others would read my posts charitably, as I have yours. The example was purely to show that it wouldn't matter whether or not you knew why the child was about to die, whether you could physically reach the child, whether or not your way of helping was less trivial than pressing a button, or even how many children there are that need help. If you can easily help someone who is suffering is there any morally relevant reason not to? 

It may be our intuition that our inactions are not morally relevant, but this is where Singer says our intuitions are wrong. In some ways that intuition is very obviously wrong. Is it wrong to let your own children starve when you are capable of providing food for them? Most people I think would agree that it is wrong; we have a moral obligation towards our children. Singer asks us why it should be different for children that aren't our own."

It might be because people threatens everyone who engage in the hashtag to never have a career, because people try to find out where people work and get them out of the job, because people want to portray them all as ""worse than ISIS"" or saying that doxing them is not as bad as doxing other people.

"Start with two Arduino Micros from a reputable seller. You'll want one to mess with while the other is running in production, and these little guys have enough pins on them to drive your project and more. Get two micro usb cables as well. Pick up a good digital multimeter, a spool of small electronic wire, a grab-bag of 1/8 watt resistors, some npn transistors, some diodes, some leds (for fun and learning), a solder less bread board, and a few SPST 5v shielded reed relays.

You can control the pump with the relay. Just cut the pump cord (near to the plug end, not the watery pump end) and splice the relay into the circuit (look this up online). You send a D/C signal to the relay which flips a completely isolated internal switch in the relay to make contact on the A/C circuit end.

I've heard that the moisture sensors don't work so well, but I have no experience with them. (Out of pure ignorance) I would suggest keeping the watering on a schedule instead of interfacing with a flaky feedback loop.

You can plug the Arduino into a server via the USB connection and pass serial data back and forth, sounds like you got that part down. I'd suggest taking a look at the Raspberry Pi if you don't already own a couple of them and seriously take a look at [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

Here's extra credit:

* Get some cheap photoresistors and measure light to make sure your cycles are running on time
* Stick a water level sensor on that barrel and report it over the internet
* Pick up a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and add it to your setup
* Get a web cam and take time-lapse photos of your plants growing
* Stream the live video over the internet

I have some real-time Arduino libraries that can help you when you start to program:

This real-time [motor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/Motor) gives you the timedOn() method, which could let your water the plants for a specific period of time.

Here's a real-time [light sensor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/LightSensor) you can use to report the light percentage of your photoresistors.

I released this real-time [water level sensor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/WaterSensor) today. All you need is an Arduino, a few resistors, a wire, and a piece of aluminum foil to accurately measure the water level of your barrel from the outside of the container.

You will see a bunch of example code that uses delay() on the internet, and this is fine to start but you should quickly jump to real-time. Read-up on how to manage your programs without delay(). People call it a state-machine but I think that word is scary, coming from someone who has pretty much mastered the concept. Once you get it; you can use this real-time [timer library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/Timer) to easily control program flow.

Good luck! Let us know about your progress!"

"Here are the steps I take to compile YouCompleteMe using visual studio:

* cd into .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
* make a new directory called 'build', cd into it
* run cmake. I use the following line:

* open YouCompleteMe.sln
* set Build type to 'Release' configuration
* right-click the BoostParts project, Project Only -&gt; Build Only BoostParts. There will be a lot of warnings, but it should complete without errors.
* right-click the ycm_core project, Project Only -&gt; Build Only ycm_core
* right-click ycm_client_support, Project Only -&gt; Build only ycm_client_support
